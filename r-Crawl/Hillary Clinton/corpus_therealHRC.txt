I wonder how much this influences her Ukraine policies, as well.> So how does an email about that translate into news?
>The emails are insightful because she really didn't know what to do. She looked to all these outside advisors. She wanted to know how [then-Senator] Carl Levin voted on the Iraq surge. What the email shows is that this is a person who was very concerned at the time about how her decision—her important, important policy decision—would reflect upon her personally, and how it would impact her standing with the public. That's important.Also shows why she shouldn't have been in that role.And why she shouldn't have an even more responsible role. Yep. How many articles can you write that have a title that starts with "Hillary's shifting stance on..."Which is horrifying. > Of course, Hillary Clinton has big policy disagreements with Dick Cheney. But as a United States senator, she joined him in favoring an Authorization for Use of Military Force that significantly expanded executive power; an outside-the-U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay; a preemptive war against Iraq; the Patriot Act, with its many civil-liberties abrogations; an expansive program of extra-legal, warrantless surveillance on tens of millions of innocent Americans; and the use of lethal drone strikes over civilian populations in Pakistan and Yemen. 

Yeah, still not seeing the big policy differences between the two at all.Learn about the policies adopted by Obama and Clinton when she was Secretary of State: extrajudicial assassinations, a secretive evaluation process of targets based on flimsy evidence, and military operations outside of war zones, all unaccountable to the public.I saw the title and wondered which one. I wasn't aware of that particular one. But, it did jog my memory on a whole host of scandals from the 1990's. None are perhaps "worst" by themselves, but they add up to a character who has a decades long career built upon secrecy, lies, coverups and questions left unanswered. Yeah, same. Obviously I didn't choose the title, I just used the same one Salon used.

There is a decent argument that this is the worst legacy of the Clintons, though, in that it preys upon the most vulnerable people in society: the children of poor people.

The fact that we as a country would let them go hungry and flounder in poverty when we could easily afford to feed, clothe, and educate them is extraordinarily disgraceful.Al Jazeera's take on far right foreign policy dominating US politics in Latin America: http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/9/hillary-clinton-honduraslatinamericaforeignpolicy.htmlObviously she doesn't really care given her attempt to disarm the public and take away the right of people to defend themselves from life threatening situations. I really wish anderson would've pressed hillary about what new information could've possibly been revealed to her about same sex marriage.

Hillary has been a lifelong and tireless opponent of marriage equality until it was politically expedient for her to adjust her position.And they say she is not honest . . . 

The key role of US military-industrial policy is to clear the way for corporate hegemony. While generally opposed to sound bites, I wish there was a way to explain all that in a sentence or two.This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://theintercept.com/2015/10/14/what-did-clinton-mean-when-she-said-snowden-files-fell-into-the-wrong-hands/) reduced by 85%.

> Hillary Clinton asserted at Tuesday night&#039;s Democratic presidential debate that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden &quot;Stole very important information that has unfortunately fallen into a lot of the wrong hands."

> Snowden turned over his cache of documents to Intercept founding editors Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, and the result has been the exposure - to the public - of the extraordinarily expansive and invasive surveillance apparatus that the U.S. government had secretly built over the years.

> Clinton&#039;s comments on Snowden were flawed in more than one way.

Don't forget the way she treats the ones that protect her! http://newsdailynow.com/2015/10/17/the-real-and-nasty-hillary/Link to full video: http://www.c-span.org/video/?69606-1/mrs-clinton-campaign-speechI had completely forgotten about this. Also the whole bill ayers/weathermen thing, too. Hillary accused Obama of...well, I'm not sure of what...being dangerous? Because he served on a school board with Bill Ayers.

At least she admitted he's not a muslim...[as far as she knows.](https://vine.co/v/OQrxv5wIMmE)
She is very secretive and confusing about this issue. This was the primary source for a lot of the stuff I found, but you can find a lot of secondary accounts.
