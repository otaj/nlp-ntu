An unbiased recounting of HRC's role in the Clinton Administration

**Health Care Reform:** When Bill Clinton was President, Hillary assumed authority over health care reform efforts. Around $13 million of taxpayer money was spent on studies and promotions. Despite these efforts, however, the issue was never voted on in Congress.

**Selecting an Attorney General:** President Clinton put Hillary in charge of the nomination process for AG. Her first two selections, Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, eventually withdrew their names from consideration. Her next recommendation was Janet Reno, who was confirmed as AG. President Clinton would come to call this decision his "worst mistake."

**Other notable HRC recommendations for Administration positions:** Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. These men were chosen from among old friends of the Clinton's during their days practicing law in Little Rock. Hubbel would eventually go to prison, Foster tragically committed suicide, and Kennedy would go on to resign in shame.

**“Travelgate”:** (scandal involving the White House Travel Office's refusal to allow Hillary to award travel contracts to longtime Clinton friend Harry Thompson.) Several members of the WH Travel Office were investigated by the FBI, and later let go from their positions. The resulting investigation lasted 36 months, and led to one criminal indictment - that of Travel Officer staffer Billy Dale for "mixing personal funds with White House funds." Dale had this charge acquitted in a trial by jury.

**"Filegate":** The Director of White House security, Craig Livingstone, was another longtime Clinton friend and Hillary recommendation. Director Livingstone came under investigation by the FBI during the "Filegate" scandal which alleged the Clinton Administration had illegal accessed hundreds of their political "enemies" private documents. During the investigation, the Clintons would deny ever knowing Livingstone outside of a professional capacity. After the Director's resignation, the FBI shut down the White House Liaison Office.

**President Clinton's impeachment and the Starr investigation:** While under indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation, Hillary repeated variations of “I do not recall” 56 times while giving testimony. She was eventually cleared of wrongdoing. 

**And here's one just for fun:** after leaving the White House, the Clinton's were asked to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that had gone missing.This is a great survey of recent news about the email scandal.Truth like this hurtsI don't like Hillary but I thought she handled that really wellIt was wordy but I agree. Oh hey, it's the dailyfail.Oh hey, it's the dailyfail.

Not the best thing when trying to become president. Especially considering her record to begin with isn't up to par to her primary challengers. Stuff like this is a prime example of why Hillary Clinton would make a terrible commander in chief. It's one thing for a president to be a warmonger, and another thing for a president to be a fool, but when a president is a foolish warmonger, then it's time to go full /r/preppers

And so that wasn't Hillary's business until it came out that her campaign takes big money from ExxonMobile http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/hillary-clinton-fundraising-bundlers-lobbyists.  I wish this girl had framed the question better....but hopefully we can all spread the word that Hillary takes what I call #GHGmoney .  hey, maybe we could get that to being a thing.More coverage: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N-qA00jSRZQ[deleted]Congratulations on 200 subscribers!

Awww look at how cute friends these two are! Looks like they are headed to prom or something.

The first one actually looks like they are getting ready to make out. I actually had the same thought. Maybe she pulled a Bill Clinton!from gross to grosser

http://www.motherjones.com/files/imagecache/top-of-content-main/kissingerclinton.jpgPhoto one: "look at how she's touching that gross turd"

Photo two: I really love how he looks like a shitbag and a sociopath.I bet they are good buddies! http://i.imgur.com/xnnPOsP.jpgNice!So Hillary believed in inequality for 95% of her life and then decided she "evolved" prior to announcing her bid for president.

Brainwashed lemmingJust another example of how she is willing to do and say anything. Once it become acceptable to be gay, no thanks her, now she includes it in her platform proudly. Now that Bernie has caught fire, she will change her positions once again to become more progressive just to get votes. Her views also evolved on the [Iraq war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS9y5t0tR0). Were **any** of these even produced by either of the Clinton campaigns?http://i.imgur.com/5Qpny4K.jpg

As far as I know only Chafee was a Republican in adult life.She also writes about volunteering to check voter registration lists against addresses to find voter fraud. And during her first year of college, she was even elected president of the Wellesley Young Republicans Club. According to Carl Bernstein's book A Woman In Charge, by the fall of 1966, she identified herself as a Rockefeller Republican.In other words I'm right, unless you count being a college freshman, before most people even form their own independent political beliefs, part of adult life.at 18 you are an adult in the eyes of the law.  at 18 you can vote and help shape the future of the nation.  at 18 you can go to war and kill or be killed.  at what age should we start holding someone accountable for the actions then?  not saying you should set your bench mark at this early of an age, but the statement true and when you try and side step it it only makes me look and think about it more than i would have... like now.  thanksI guess I just don't know why you think anybody would care that somebody was a Republican at 19. Certainly anybody that hardcore of a Democrat would already be turned off by the fact that in this same forum is a link to an article in a conservative outlet urging Clinton to embrace the TPP.i could care less what she did then.  i was just saying don't say she wasn't, when she was.  it is that kind of stuff why i don't trust any thing with the name clinton next to it.  whenever a clinton trys a dodge i just ask why?  like i do for every perosn wanting my vote and i would hope you would do the same.  i am much more concerned about how she is side stepping ttp right now and her current relationship to wall street.  could you agree with that?Then what the hell are you doing splitting hairs about whether a 19-year old is an adult?excuse me didn't think i was.  thought i was responding to the idea that she was a child and kids don't know anything anything any how, so what defence.  again there is enough current issue to care about.
