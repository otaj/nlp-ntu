To be fair, there are a lot more viable options for CEOs to donate to on the Republican side.  They're *not* going for Sanders, so there's really only one Dem that they could get behind.  
On the Republican side they are splitting their money up in between Rubio, Bush, Kasich, and probably a few even going for any of the zany quartet of Cruz, Florina, Trump, and Carson.
\>Says she didn't do most of her work by email

\>Has an entire private server to store her email and classified documentsShe looked presidential and they looked juvenile. If you want to know what a Clinton administration will look like, loop the hearing for 4 years straight.Her troubles never existed. This is a a witch hunt that has gone nowhere.The FBI investigation suggests otherwise.I'm not interested in suggests.  When you have something post it. Until then quit wasting my time.You clearly haven't read any of the posts in this subreddit. We've spent months documenting the illegalities and rule-breaking involved in Clinton setting up a private homebrew server and email for all of her government communications. When you read them, get back to us with an informed response to the posts. No sense in talking unless you do your homework.No, just like the republicans you have spent months making suggestions. With Hillary running for president any proven allegation would be acted on.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/10/justice-department-rules-hillary-clinton-followed-/Sorry but that ruling concerns deletion of her personal emails. Try again. :)Exactly, everything they investigate turns up nothing.Her personal emails were never the subject of an investigation. Strike 2. :)I laughed for a solid 3 minutes over the notion that HillC would get 10 minutes in a cell, much less 10 years. Bam isn't going to allow a fellow Dem, regardless of who, to go under the gavel, PERIOD. PERIOD. It simply isn't going to happen. You and I do not get to play by the same rules (lack of rules?) as HC and the Dem elite. They simply don't give a flying fuck about the Constitution, the US Code, or any other law you care to name. Bam is a Constitutional Scholar? HAH!  All that means is he knows how to beat it. And frankly, we deserve the bullshit they create for allowing them to get away with it all through the slick willy era. USA = FUCKED. At most she'll get charged with a misdemeanor. But even that could end her candidacy for president.The Dem voters simply do not care. They would vote for a ham sandwich with a D by its name. Dems vote Dem first, no matter.Her response was absolutely disgusting and misdirection. She's only against TPP when voters are listening. She's no longer acting apologetic about this.  She's kinda acting cocky about it now.  When she heard Bernie say he was sick of hearing about her emails,  she thought that meant that she was off the hook. It's so f-d up that the GOP managed to blow what should have been an open-and-shut case of misconduct (minimum) and possible felonies (maximum).This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/12/d-n-c-officer-says-she-was-disinvited-from-debate-after-calling-for-more-of-them/) reduced by 86%.

Hill? just another day in paradise.  drip drip drip.Honestly, it sounds like she is really unhappy with her life. Part of me things that after the Lewinsky scandal her marriage ended behind the scenes, and since getting a divorce would be political suicide her and Bill agreed to stay together for political reasons.

One question I really don't know the answer to is why does she even want to be president? Is it just a power grab? If she hates it that much maybe she would be happier retiring and getting out of the spotlight.

In some ways I almost feel bad for her. I certainly would not want to be in her place.[Based on this article](http://harpers.org/archive/2014/10/stop-hillary-2/) it seems like the whole of her marriage was based in large part on political calculation.You could be right. Or maybe she's just a hateful bitch with no respect for anyone. There's no way to know, because she's a politician and she's great at hiding her true self.
The hillary portrayed in this story sounds like a sociopath, I'm not surprised.I just came here to post a link to that story.  If it's true, it reveals her true personality and why Democrats should support Bernie Sanders, instead.  How you treat other people when the cameras are not on speaks volumes.

There may also be a new Bill "bimbo eruption" brewing.  Rumor has it that he has a smashing blond mistress nicknamed "Energizer" by the Secret Service.  Of course, that's completely irrelevant to the merits of a candidate.  However, it's just one more distraction that the Democratic candidate could do without.HAHA fantastic!So the socialist spends money more wisely than his less-frugal adversary...hmmmm.....I always knew Bernie was more likeable and now I'm more than certain he'd run the country's finances better than the ~~Hillster~~ huckster!!!!GOD, she sucks. The woman who could possibly run our country everybody! **slow claps**Nobody is waiting for baited breath.Note, it is the donors who are urging.  They are urging because lovable Joe is more controllable than Bernie.  They are terrified of Bernie.Obama would prefer his loyal VP to any other Dem. Is that a help to his primary run and eventual electability?The article lost credibility the moment they blamed Obama for the troop withdrawal from Iraq. It is a matter of fact that the withdrawal was negotiated and finalized by George W, Bush.

Edit - I hate Hillary as much as the next objective observer. > the withdrawal was negotiated and finalized by George W, Bush.

The Obama administration actually wanted a status of forces agreement.

The finger, it says, should be pointed not at Mr. Obama but at those who pressed him to attempt training Syrian rebels in the first place — a group that, in addition to congressional Republicans, happened to include former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.All these points are on the dot.XPost Subreddit Link: /r/American_Politics

^^[Contact](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=OriginalPostSearcher) ^^| ^^[Code](https://github.com/papernotes/Reddit-OriginalPostSearcher)This is why people don't see her as trustworthy. Even if this is much ado about nothing, she's handled everything about this in a very suspicious way.Great postok' let us take a walk down this path which appears to suggest something positive for team Clinton.  the argument here appears to be that team Clinton paid for the maintenance, administration, and support for the clintonemail server, and as such this server arraingment did not cost the government and taxpayers anything to use this external server operation.  Team Clintons message here is "all is good here".  

now let us transport ourselves to the current state of the cost of the clintonemail server, and that cost is that we (the taxpayers) are paying for a team of forensic experts to analyze the clintonemail server to minimally determine if there we national security exposures due to the clintonemail server.

how much is that team of experts costing ?  is team Clinton paying for the cost of the forensic team ?  Having a lead 5 months before the primaries begin and a rapidly sinking public image doesn't mean a lot either.With email, like any other unencrypted communication, you don't need access to the server anyway, just any part of the communications path to it for whatever communications traverse it.  If the server is the most secure server in the world and the first hop router is cracked then it's game over.That seems . . . huge.

Interesting, I wonder who the superdelegate is.Bill Clinton!! /s :)this is pretty scary.  clintons believe they are above the law.  clintons should know best that they are targets of every nation and to place confidential emails on a separate server is pretty scary.  hopefully no one else was able to access this info but you never know.  look at wikileaks, etc.    there is a very good chance clinton faces charges.  Dems are using Biden as insurance policy, if not Trump wins this easy.I agree. I fear that a Clinton presidency will be as bad as or almost as bad for the rule of law as the Bush-Cheney years.I agree with you.  Bernie and Biden are just fine although I worry about Bernie's health.

All the best,I'm not so scared of her winning (v. Bernie) so much any more these days.How can we trust Hillary to be our president if she can't keep secrets now. As far as I'm concerned, she's a national security threat.Rasmussen [isn't really reliable.](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/which-polls-fared-best-and-worst-in-the-2012-presidential-race/?_r=0)Like any other source, understand the biases and they become a useful input.If Biden joins he will pull Clinton votes and accelerate her loss to Sanders. Dammit, this man is insightful.  I'm sure there's a ton I don't agree with him on, but he's certainly worth listening to.Yeah, Dick Morris is all over the place. In 2012, he bet all his credibility on Romney winning and claimed that all the pre-election polls were dead wrong. So some times he is on point and other times he might as well be talking about UFOs. lolA lot of people in the echo chamber believed Romney would easily win.  I guess it also depends on how much faith they put in the election fraud efforts.Title 18-2071;

As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States. Great video. He also says that a grand jury could indict just for using her private served, not only deleting them.To big of an "if".I'm not a lawyer but to me I don't understand how this whole thing will end without any indictments, maybe not of Clinton herself but at least people working with or under her.> people working with or under her.

Oh yeah. Hillary will throw them fine folks under the bus for sure.If she does, they'll drag her down with them and testify against her, especially if they aren't part of her inner circle like Huma Abedin.These tactics are disgusting.

I was under the impression that she had the one private email server at her home, which she has now begrudgingly handed over to the FBI, likely to avoid an actual subpoena. The one she deleted half of the emails from.

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/American_Politics/comments/3fjly9/joe_biden_adviser_says_vice_president_is_90_in/I will not vote for Hillary. If Bernie is not nominated i will vote 3rd party, probably Jill Stein of the Green party again. Hillary is a sociopath just like most republicans.Yup. If America doesn't want to vote smart then it has to feel the the smart of it's dumb choice. I'm fairly confident that whoever the GOP nominates I'll have to vote for Hillary.  The field is pretty scary. That and being in Florida I don't really have the luxury of throwing in a protest vote for a third party.That's because they were edited to be disturbing. And any competent leader should know this. So we have two options here:

1. She is incompetent.

2.  (the more likely reason) She is lying.This seems to be the case for several reasons.  Can't handle 2 e-mail address? Incompetence or lying.   Refuse to state position on important issues?  Incompetence or lying.  I'm starting to think she's a DINO.In other words, "You really aren't going to like what I have to say about it, so I won't say anything until it's too late for you to change your mind."

I imagine it like buying a used car, and you ask: "Do the brakes work good?" and getting the response "Well, I guess you'll find out when you're driving it home, right? Sign here, please." Sharron Angle gave a similar response when she was running against Senator Reid.  It was delivered better by Clinton but the point remains clear:  You don't get to know until it is too late.  I read that as Feel The Bern.[Ah, the memories!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-05TLiiLU)i cringedDisgusting!  She's on record supporting the TPP, numerous other sellouts to big business, so what makes anyone think that she's got our interest in mind?

So naturally, everyone is against the Keystone (because it DOESN'T create permanent jobs and it'll cost more than it gains after just one spill!) so Hillary just has to lie and scapegoat, hope it goes away and she can become president and give it the go-ahead.

Thanks, Obama, for even having this on the table still!Why is the Keystone pipeline such a big deal when we have many similar pipelines already in use over much of the same geography?  Is it just a symbol or is there something actually amiss with this particular pipeline?There are [numerous concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Pipeline#Keystone_XL_controversies)Flawed impact studies and the risk of leakage is SOP for pipelines.  While I agree that these are concerns for all pipelines I don't see why this one gets singled out.  In what way is this pipeline worse than the ones already in place?Even if you disregard all the concerns (which I don't), installing the pipeline makes oil easier to get and an even more attractive option, increasing our reliance on it. Liberals want to stop increasing our reliance on oil in any way possible.That's how I see it too.  One side of me says a pipeline (or another one as it were) is safer than exploding trains but if we're going to be symbolic about this pipeline representing big-oil and all things un-green then I'll accept the totem for what it is.  I'd just like someone to spell it out to be sure.Even if you are going to get the oil from Canada, it would make more sense to process it and use it in Canada as local as possible.  This pipeline moves it all the way through the United States and some of which will go back.  It's all that extra energy being used that doesn't have to be used to transport it for processing it.  It is one of the worst imagined plans even if you are in favor of using that oil.3 Big reasons, really?I'm writing the following for my own sanity:

I have told so many people on Reddit this for months since the Democratic primary run started and I've been fought on this over and over again as people say "but look at her poll numbers!". 

No. Swing states have been been trending red and Clinton is losing ground among independents who control the victory in swing states. The election is decided by swing states and Hillary Clinton cannot win enough of them to win the presidency. She'll take Minnesota, Colorado, and probably Nevada and Michigan. Maybe Florida if Jeb Bush isn't running. Otherwise, she'll lose all of the other states: North Carolina, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia, New Mexico, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. All of these states have been trending red and Hillary Clinton isn't well liked by as many people as her supporters think. If she is the democratic nominee, she will lose.  

Fuck it just feels good to hear.Clearly not more electable.[deleted]Thanks!While this makes me happy, I'm wondering why Sanders was left out, especially since his numbers are on the rise.

Oh wait, it's probably because his numbers are on the rise.Again, no specifics. Just talk.I watched her speech. 

Your title is spot on. Everything with her is just a bunch of feel-good ideas being said, without anything to show for it. Lots of talk, but nothing concrete.Whoa.  Hang on here.  Does this mean that Hillary . . . lied?Seems reasonable to me.Why? What's wrong with shaking hands with someone with a "White" tattoo!? For all we know it's his last name. What's the big deal? To me this seems disrespectful.Posting it was a mistake. Deleting it made it an issue.We don't know what that tattoo means and it's prejudiced to assume.

The real problem for the Clinton's is that it is just one more unpleasant reminder of how filthily they campaigned in 2008.



"(CNN) — In what appear to be the New York senator’s most blunt comments to date regarding a racial division in the Democratic presidential race, Hillary Clinton suggested Wednesday that “White Americans” are increasingly turning away from Barack Obama’s candidacy.

“I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on,” Clinton said in an interview with USA TODAY.

Clinton cited an Associated Press poll “that found how Senator Obama’s support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me.”

“There’s a pattern emerging here,” she said.

Exit polls from Tuesday’s primaries in Indiana and North Carolina show Clinton won about 60 percent of the white vote in both states. That percentage is down from the Ohio primary on March 4, in which Clinton won upwards of 65 percent of the white vote. Meanwhile, Clinton garnered 63 percent of the white vote in Pennsylvania on April 22.

Speaking with the paper, Clinton rejected the notion her comments were racially divisive in any way.

“These are the people you have to win if you’re a Democrat in sufficient numbers to actually win the election,” she said. “Everybody knows that.”

Obama spokesman Bill Burton called Clinton’s statements “not true and frankly disappointing.”"



"The third-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives and one of the country’s most influential African-American leaders sharply criticized former President Bill Clinton this afternoon for what he called Mr. Clinton’s “bizarre” conduct during the Democratic primary campaign.


Representative James E. Clyburn, an undeclared superdelegate from South Carolina who is the Democratic whip in the House, said that “black people are incensed over all of this,” referring to statements that Mr. Clinton had made in the course of the heated race between his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Senator Barack Obama."

It was construed as racist by many people, and the Hillary camp didn't want there to be any confusion. For example on this sub, we remove comments that can be construed as sexist, but aren't 100% explicitly sexist, because it's the best policy.Oh but wow. Is that the kind of president she is going to be? Is Hillary's not a prejudiced and reactionary response to what may well be a completely innocent word? It isn't s confederate flag. It isn't a swastika. It's just the word "white."

It's Ok to have picture on your Twitter of you shaking hands with a supporter who has a tattoo of the name of a color on his arm.

#"white"tattosdon'tmatter.
A sad reflection on our country is that we will still vote for a candidate we don't trust.Lying about people trusting her...The same old song and dance from the 90's: 

Smoke?  Check.
Mirrors?  Check.
Blaming right-wing conspiracy?  Check.Outright lying here:

>Clinton said she turned over all the emails -- including some which show her using a secured fax machine, or asking for iced tea during meetings -- that had anything to do with public business, and that she broke no laws in sticking with one device because she's not technically savvy.

This is just complete bullshit. It takes infinitely more technological savvy to setup and use a freaking personal private email server! Not to mention that the State Department itself has said she hasn't turned over some of them, and that they can prove it. I just can't believe all these lies. Wouldn't want to squander that billion dollar war chest on stupid wages, now would we.Excellent idea!Why exactly do you believe an unconstitutional bill enforcing a private organization's rules on the nation with large fines is an excellent idea?Come hell or high water, the mainstream media is going to vote as a block for their favorite porcine pantsuited phony Progressive. Hillary can abuse these girls like a hopelessly drunken husband and they will crawl back begging for another beating they mistake for love and affection. Who else have they got? The pathetically partisan press are as repelled by Republicans as a hydrophobic hound is adverse to water. Hoary Hillary knows this better than even the roped off journalists.Ha! Just the opposite of Sanders. Sanders will talk to the press all the time, take questions. It makes you wonder why one candidate has to have everything very controlled and scripted, and the other (Sanders) can talk to anyone at anytime, and has nothing to hide.http://www.frugal-cafe.com/public_html/frugal-blog/frugal-cafe-blogzone/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/homeland-security-message-get-back-into-your-free-speech-zone-political-poster.jpgOh no!

Now she might pretend to take Bernie's stances on the issues, negating much of his advantage!And Bernie will be too much of a gentleman to point it out?Probably.

It would make me want to crowd-fund my own attack ad against Hillary, though.[deleted]If we can let R think he can't win and let them bolster his position against Hillary, R may very well be driving their replacement where he wants to be.[deleted]She wouldn't be popular enough to win reelection by as much of a margin as I think she'll win the first time. But I think she'll retain enough votes from the slim block of undecideds in the middle from many not wanting to vote the first female president out of office, as well as the immense incumbent advantage she'll have. How can anybody actually believe she'll fight for LGBT rights when in office?[deleted]You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but all you need is to fool enough of the voters to win an election.There are sexists everywhere, even among Democrats unfortunately. :-(

Goooo Hillary! Wooo!You forgot the /s tag. It would be sexist to vote for somebody just because of their gender and better candidates are available.What exactly do you feel is sexist?You. Misogynist would be a more appropriate term.Interesting. Care to share a reason? I consider myself a pretty fair, non-misogynistic guy. It's actually pretty insulting to be called that.It seems pretty arrogant to me that you would argue the only reason anyone could possibly dislike Hillary is because of her sex.

I dislike Hillary for a great many reasons,--her policy record, her hypocrisy, etc.--but her sex isn't one of them.I'm British. I watched [this](http://news.yahoo.com/video/presidential-hopeful-bernie-sanders-talks-202700207.html) interview with him yesterday. He seems like a very good candidate. I would love to see him get elected. Sadly though I think there are too many powerful people with vested interests to keep him out.Like [Obama](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/9167332/Barack-Obama-microphone-gaffe-Ill-have-more-flexibility-after-election.html), she'll have much more latitude after the election.>I believe marriage is not just a bond but a sacred bond between a man and a woman. I have had occasion in my life to defend marriage, to stand up for marriage, to believe in the hard work and challenge of marriage. So I take umbrage at anyone who might suggest that those of us who worry about amending the Constitution are less committed to the sanctity of marriage, or to the fundamental bedrock principle that it exists between a man and a woman, going back into the mist of history as one of the founding, foundational institutions of history and humanity and civilization, and that its primary, principal role during those millennia has been the raising and socializing of children for the society into which they are to become adults.[deleted]I do see the the solid reasoning behind the strategy you describe. If  republicans send Jeb out there I think it's pretty smooth sailing for Hillary, however I think it would be even smoother for Biden or another decent Dem. too true/u/PaulG1974

There's nothing intrinsically wrong with someone saying "this system has problems" even as they've benefited from it, and I think that at least some voters will be able to understand that distinction. It sounds like however that you think this will be a complete deal-killer in the general election if she gets that far. So, conditional on her winning the nomination, how likely do you expect it is that she'll lose the general election? I agree that benefiting from laws you disagree with is absolute fine. I don't agree with so much hypocrisy she spews regarding policy, legal and otherwise. I am. to just talking about her own earning, or the shadyness of the TWO Clinton foundations.   I was at her UCLA speech when she lambasted businesses that don't pay interns, and essentially take advantage of the free workforce. yet the Clinton foundation has about 100 full time interns they don't pay then a cent. A very small percentage  get a meager clothing or travel allowance that is like 2000 for internships over four months. While not lead by example for a change? The  other  major US foundations like Gates and Ford not only pay interns competitive salaries , they do matching charitable donations and  housing and education  subsidies. The Clinton's do none of this. Why not lead from the front for a change? Even the email server, how dare she potentially jeopardize the security of our country for her own privacys sake? 

I don't think anything is a deal killer for Hillary in the general election. The system is currently built for democratic wins, especially with the horrible financial gap between upper middle class/rich to the lower middle class and poor.  I think she is a strong favorite to win like 2-1 vs bush. Probably a lesser favorite against Rubio or Walker.  Maybe 60-40. However I think Joe Biden or another solid Dem  without the Hillary baggage would be a far stronger favorite. I will say if she blows this election she will go down as the worst presidential candidate of our time. Literally she will be the "anti Bill Clinton" as we all know he was a great candidate and a solid president.  If she blows this one coupled with the 2008 failure vs a complete unknow when she was virtually ordained the Dem candidate she will make the wrong kind of history.Ah, I see. I'm essentially in agreement with you regarding the email and the Clinton Foundation. I was focusing purely on the primary issue brought up in the OP. I have been summoned!LOL Joe get in there baby! [deleted]Exactly. The targeting of Hillary and Obama for the Benghazi attack is just a Republican scheme. My **big** problem though is Hillary's destruction of evidence, and setting up the server in the first place! Shows some intent to hide something.[deleted]Yeah, I've noticed that too.Well. You just got another follower, so I hope it's gonna even out.. I won't comment anymore because I think Bernie's stance on negative attacks are spot on and not needed. Also, I imagine the circlejerk (which I participate in) here is even worse than in /r/SandersForPresident. But I will gladly upvote a post if the link is a serious source with a good point, because the fact that america might have another Clinton vs Bush is fucking terrifying. :)This is interesting because I had previously assumed that Vox was all in for Hillary Clinton. Nice to see that they're at least attempting to explore some different perspectives.THIS SO MUCHHow is she panning to pay off all the favors (implied or explicit) that she's having to make in order to reap all this cold, hard cash in only 4 years?!? When she loses the primary, is she going to turn over all this money to the winner or is it going straight into the Clinton Foundation?This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/06/04/activist-behind-hillstarter-crowdfunding-site-afford-meeting-hillary-clinton-speaks/) reduced by 70%.

It will in any case.If you watch the video this comes from, Sanders actually never says this - they just edit the conversation in such a way as to make it seem like he made that the direct implication. Sanders is going to run into this sort of thing a lot in the campaign I think. He want to refrain from negativity, but since the central theme of his campaign is implicitly critical of Hillary, and the media is determined to only convey the horse race aspect, the result is going to be stuff like this, where Sanders says something about an issue, Hillary is bad on that issue, and the media just skips to claiming that Sanders is criticizing Hillary with as little talk as possible about the issue. This is problematic because if people aren't able to relate criticism of Hillary to substantial issues, then they are going to assume that the criticism is not something that they should care about. This article at least conveys the issue on the table though.The link: http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/21/politics/clinton-foundation-speech-income/index.html
