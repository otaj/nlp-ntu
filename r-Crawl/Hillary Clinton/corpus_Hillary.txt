/r/anybodybuthillaryI wish there's a way she could avoid testifying. It just gives legitimacy to the committee. Democrats need to boycott it. Oh I'm glad she's testifying. I've seen Republicans try to brow beat Hillary during testimony before. It's like watching children interrogate an adult. They're just not intellectually anywhere near her level. She had nothing to fear even before McCarthy went full retard.New York Post. Oh I'm sure this will be good.

Opinion. Oh man, can't wait.

Ken Cuccinelli. Oh god, my sides.seriously...it's not even a good attempt> Ken Cuccinelli is president of Senate Conservatives Fund

Hillary was pretty funny in that interview. I guess I don't see the big deal in her once being against it. At one time, we all were in some way, either passively or aggressively. But we learn more about others and ourselves and hopefully change for the better.

I see that as a positive: someone who realizes their wrongdoings and changes to make it right.

The media can run with this "story" as much as they want, but they have to know they're just as guilty as she was/is."I want something completely equivalent to gay marriage in everything but name" to "I want gay marriage" is not even a *bit* of a different stance than today. It absolutely is.Your at 150 subs! Keep on going!153 Subs! Congrats girls!Looking forward to another 4-8 years of manufactured scandals!Headline:

>Hillary Clinton: Let’s Be Honest, Black Men In Hoodies Are Scary

Actual quote:

>“I mean if we’re honest, for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear,”

OP, this is a bullshit claim and you know it.  You couldn't find anything bad she actually said, so you had to post a lie?If you don't think that quote is dambing, then you're the asshole. Not the blogger, not OP.Can anyone find a link to the full interview?Yea, I haven't heard this speech, but the fact that they cropped it down to only 13 seconds, intentionally cropping out any context leads me to believe the person who did this *doesn't want* us to know the rest, because it's probably pretty reasonable.

She's not wrong. Racism is still going strong, and there are white people who are afraid of black guys in hoodies.  I'm pretty sure the rest of her speech was something along the lines of "and that's wrong, and we need to do something about that."I'm an average looking white guy.  I have 1 jacket thats from a bands concert.  But it looks like a gang related jacket from the 90s.  Took me a few months to figure out why when I'd walk down the sidewalk people would cross the street to avoid me.  I was offended.  I dont wear that jacket anymore.Not the most tactful thing for her to say.I thought her corporatist/bank loving tendencies were well known.  I see this is getting down-voted.  

You don't want to know stuff like this is getting said about Hillary?  Only one way to deal with stuff like this and you can't even start if you don't know about it.   Don't turn this sub into the Fox news channel for Hillary, that's what I'm saying.  No surprise at all.  She's pumped full of bank and corporate money.  She is for TPP, the pipeline, Wall Street.  She's not for the citizenry.I'm a Sanders supporter already but I had no idea she had that kind of money. Makes me wonder where he's lived.And what, Hillary, is a fair economy?
That educated people earn more money than the uneducated?
Flipping burgers pays less than an accountant?
Yep, that is fair.
So, blah, blah "FAIR" ... but somehow she is neglecting the fact that there are so many under-educated people. How can she provide FAIR, without providing a solution to the education problem in this country? Giving people something they haven't earned, doesn't sound fair, does it?Explain to me this: Why would you be so lacking in taste right out of the gate? Are you 12? 

I'm voting for Bernie but, just saying...So edgy.Yes, a very progressive thinker. Hillary will go down - Obama is just waiting for the right moment to throw her under the bus. I'm far more interested in seeing the actual poll and how the questions were asked verses reading a reporters interpretation. Fair, next time I'll link to the results themselves.Seriously would like to how anybody could support her,  there are so many red flags with herShe's tough, smart, pragmatic, and liberal. She's been a Democrat standard bearer for 30 years. So....there ya go.Hillary yesI couldn't have said better. It's almost like yet another politician is only in this industry for themselves.

weird.Almost like ...?Natural News... the bane of my Facebook experience.  One completely bullshit article after another plastered by gullible idiots.

Protip:  Natural News is "fake news."  None of what they talk about on that site has any basis in reality.  It doesn't matter how many "likes" you get, oatmeal won't cure your cancer.Highlights from NaturalNews include the "facts" on how we need *more* CO2 in the atmosphere, how eating MSG is literally a sin against God, and that one time he encouraged his followers to murder scientists working in plant transgenics. If you want to go and criticize Hillary, this seems like one of the absolutely stupidest ways to do so.

You are using an absolutely terrible source. Natural News is just awful. There's also nothing intrinsically wrong with GMOs at all. If you want to talk about specific problems with some things that Monsanto has done as a corporation that's one thing.

I'm curious though RAndrewOhge, what probability do you assign to Hillary winning the primary, to her winning the general? If anyone REALLY remembers Benghazi-it DID matter, not to mention the history of "iffy" dealings during the Rose Law Firm years and the subsequent Arkansas Governorship and Clinton Presidency, then there SHOULDN'T be ANY chance at all.

But we ARE talking about the typically partisan AMerican voter-so, it's a "toss of the dice".

As to Monsanto, GMO's remain full of potential issues, not least of which is the E-Coli-based Bacteriophage used to carry the traits and it's totally UNTESTED provenance. Then there's Glyphosate, which is emerging as even more dangerous to the health of all life, as well as the biosphere.

As a Corporate Entity, they have redefined the Art of Dirty Tricks.
> If anyone REALLY remembers Benghazi-it DID matter, not to mention the history of "iffy" dealings during the Rose Law Firm years and the subsequent Arkansas Governorship and Clinton Presidency, then there SHOULDN'T be ANY chance at all.

Can you explain why you think Benghazi matters at all? Can you also explain why you consider Hillary Clinton responsible for her husband's Presidency, and if you do consider her responsible why she doesn't also get credit for 8 years of peace and prosperity?

> As to Monsanto, GMO's remain full of potential issues, not least of which is the E-Coli-based Bacteriophage used to carry the traits and it's totally UNTESTED provenance.

Huh? E. coli is not a bacteriophage. A bacteriophage is a type of virus. Words have meanings. It might help to take a basic biology course before deciding you can make decisions about these things.

> Then there's Glyphosate, which is emerging as even more dangerous to the health of all life, as well as the biosphere.

Glyphosate is not a GMO. It is a broad spectrum herbicide. 

Do a little research other than just following mainstream narratives...it's just NOT that hard anymore.I'm going to leave aside for now that I disagree with just about every single sentence in that piece, aside from noting that many countries have had women as leaders and done just fine (Britain and Israel both come to mind). 

I'm more curious on your testable claim:

> Never in the history of this great nation has a woman become POTUS and I don’t foresee it happening this upcoming election. Men will rise from all cracks of the earth to make sure that this doesn’t happen. I’m sure of it.

How sure is sure? What fraction of men do you expect to "rise up" and vote for another candidate? Hillary lost 8 years ago. What makes you think that she can or even should win now? What has changed?Hillary lost the primary 8 years ago to a strong candidate. She's playing a much more careful ground game this time and her field of other candidates are much weaker.

Let me ask you two questions then: a) what probability do you assign to her losing the primary? b) what probability do you assign to her losing the general if she wins the primary? ~15%, ~45%That doesn't seem unreasonable, and I suspect much better calibrated than /u/ManLogic (although they haven't provided estimates yet). Actually the first one is off. 10% is much more consistent with the oddsmakers these days.I didn't say it was correct, I said it didn't seem unreasonable. I think a reasonable person could guess anywhere from about 5-20% for the first one. Out of curiosity, what's your range for the second one?I assign around a 65% chance that Hillary will win the general. However, I have a slight history of overconfidence in political predictions, so 60% seems safer. To be clear, that's your unconditional probability, right? So you think if she wins the primary she'll be something like a 70-80% favorite?No that's my probability for her winning the general without any given. I assign a high probability for her winning the primary, on the order of 90% or slightly higher.  There is a decent chance that Hillary might win the primary but I seriously doubt she will become President. She will be almost 70 years old. Do we want an old woman in her 70s running the country?> There is a decent chance that Hillary might win the primary but I seriously doubt she will become President. She will be almost 70 years old. Do we want an old woman in her 70s running the country?

We've had Presidents that age before. You seem to care much more about her gender and seem to think that many people will have an active problem with her gender.

I'm curious, in your blog post you wrote that: 

> Never in the history of this great nation has a woman become POTUS and I don’t foresee it happening this upcoming election. Men will rise from all cracks of the earth to make sure that this doesn’t happen. I’m sure of it.

Does that mean you expect her to lose the popular vote by a large amount as many men show up to vote against her? Yes. Many people will have an active problem with her gender. Men AND women will vote against her. Women want to feel safe and secure while as men are both physically and emotionally stronger than women.Suppose someone offered to bet you $50 that conditional on Hillary being the Democratic primary nominee, she will win at least 43% of the popular vote in the general. Would you take that bet on the side of having less than that percentage? No. I would not bet anything based on percentages. I would bet solely on a win or loss. There's much room between now and the election so we'll see how things pan out. Hillary will not get my vote.Curious, you wouldn't bet on percentages but you claim there will be a mass turnout against her. Can you explain your reasoning?

(Also for reasons I don't understand your userpage is showing as non-existing, I'm not sure why that's the case.) Also, curious assuming you would just bet on the general result, what percentage would you assign to Hillary losing the general given that she wins the primary? Is this article for real? It reads like it's from the Onion. People may prefer Hillary to Sanders also because they genuinely prefer more moderate positions on many issues and would rather a moderate Democrat be in charge than a far liberal. Still looking for answers?Number 2 isn't a non-answer, it's reality.  He's an admitted socialist.  He doesn't hide it.  That alone will kill his chances in a general election, and unless come primary time he's polling significantly higher than Clinton there's no way the Democrats will put all their hopes, dreams and money behind him.  

The sad fact is up until only a few decades ago there was very strong and very successful propaganda against anything to do with socialism.  I'm guessing you're in the 30 or below age bracket so you don't remember it.  For the majority of Americans, though (the vast majority of those that actually vote), the mere mention of the word is enough to either scare them or anger them.  All the GOP needs to do is run TV spots showing clips where Bernie says he's a socialist and they've won.  Recent Gallup polls support this: More than half of the country still hold a negative view of the word socialism, even among Democrats, and only a third of Americans have a positive view.  Bernie not going to get every single one of those 1/3, so you still have an uphill battle convincing a *lot* of Americans that Bernie is their guy *and* that their long held, deeply instilled belief about socialism is wrong.  I guarantee you the mass media, left or right, won't help you educate people (even on the difference between socialism and democratic socialism) so it's entirely a grassroots effort.  

You can show them individual policies all you want, but if you think that's enough to make them overcome the label then you put too much faith in the average voter.  Look at Obamacare for one of many examples; the vast majority of Americans support it when you explain it, but when you mention the word Obamacare support, even from the same people, plummets.  Same when you explain liberal / left-wing policies; people support them, up until they find out it's something considered liberal.  Imagine how bad it'll be when people find out you've been trying to sell them socialist policies and ideas.  

Even if he didn't say he was socialist, his policies are too left-wing for the majority of Americans to consider right now.  Obama won two hard fought elections with people calling him socialist, communist, liberal and all sorts of other words they thought were nasty.  Even when it came down to just his policies a very large amount of voters were hesitant or even turned off because he was too liberal for them.  Obama, compared to Bernie, is a centrist at most.  I don't see America, or the Democratic party, suddenly shifting so far left that Bernie becomes viable.  

The simple, unfortunate truth is he is unelectable in the current political climate.  He's a damn good candidate and I wish it weren't the case, but in my opinion he's the 2016 version of Kucinich.  He's a populist politician with his heart in the right place.  He's willing to say what needs to be said, and he genuinely believes it.  But America, and the media, won't take him serious.  Kucinich's downfall, the point where the media stopped taking him serious, was I think his UFO comment.  Bernie will be his socialism.  The country just isn't ready for it.

Also, I don't think Number 1 is a non-answer, either.  Bernie is already far older than Reagan was at inauguration, and he was the oldest President we ever had.  Hillary is even getting flak for being too old, as was McCain when he last ran, and they're all younger than Bernie.  It may not be an issue to you, but the media and his opponents will certainly make it an issue.  Those dictators and warlords you mentioned, by the way, they weren't democratically elected...do you think if they ran in an actual election their age wouldn't come up as a possible issue?

Another possible issue:  He's got an F rating from the NRA.  I know a lot of voters (I come from a conservative family) that wouldn't vote for him for that reason alone.  If they thought Obama was coming after their guns...

Edit: Yet another possible issue: Bernie is Jewish, but he's never talked about his beliefs so many, many people consider him atheist. The atheist community, such that it is, by and large consider him one of their own. Historically (and according to recent polls) neither being Jewish or being atheist is a good thing for a presidential candidate.

Anyway, as for Clinton, I'm not supporting her because I think she's the best candidate.  I'm not supporting her because I feel she represents me the best.  I'm supporting her because she's the best and most representative of my views out of all the possible candidates on either side that have a realistic chance of winning.This answer(s) from JPOnion is so flawed... First of all, nationally 48% of Americans say they would vote for a socialist (not just democrats, but ALL Americans). Also overall democrats are very much far left leaning this election cycle, this is why we are seeing Hillary making more far left/progressive talking points every day, and basically matching Bernie in his talking points (even though she doesn't truly stand behind them). This isn't 2008 and its not the 90's, this country is very much ready for a progressive.  Second of all, Bernie Sanders isn't far left on all positions, and many bi partisan political analysts consider him more center left than anything.   Also you mention him being too supportive of gun control, but he has a more moderate stance on gun control than Hillary Clinton. "Anyway, as for Clinton, I'm not supporting her because I think she's the best candidate. I'm not supporting her because I feel she represents me the best. I'm supporting her because she's the best and most representative of my views out of all the possible candidates on either side that have a realistic chance of winning."  That is SO SAD to read. Literally the stupidest and most defeatist way to vote... If you looked at the progressive movement in this country you would realize Sanders had a chance, and regardless you should vote for who you think represents you best, THATS WHAT THE PRIMARY IS FOR! Even if you put your vote behind Bernie and he doesn't win the nomination, it doesn't mean you can't support Hillary in the general election. This sort of defeatist attitude is exactly what is making American politics go down the drain.

Lastly, there are simply more democrats and progressives in this country than there are republicans. With good energy behind a  candidate and a good grassroots get out the vote effort, no Republican will stand a chance. In that sense, Bernie is a better candidate for the general election because he actually has strong grassroots energy behind him. Unlike Hillary who continues to drop in the early primary state polls, and has very little unpaid energy behind her. This cycle in particular, any Democrat who gets the nomination has a strong chance of winning, especially given how scattered the GOP is right now.What a very appropriate username.  You've perfectly encapsulated the fantastical, fuck-you facts attitude the Bernie-bots have been flooding /r/politics with lately.

> First of all, nationally 48% of Americans say they would vote for a socialist 

You might want to re-read this poll and what it means.  It doesn't say 47% (that's the actual number) would vote for a socialist, it says *only* 47% would *consider* voting for a socialist.  It also says 50% of Americans would *not* even consider voting for him at all.  In other words, unless this number drastically changes more than half of Americans will not even consider voting for him.  Additionally, you fail to mention that in this same poll "socialist" is the *worst* trait a candidate could have, below being atheist or muslim.  Try as you might, you Bernie-bots can't twist this around to somehow be a positive.

> Hillary making more far left/progressive talking points every day

That's also because Hillary is a progressive candidate on her own.  Hillary is hawkish on a few issues, but by and large *facts* and *history* show she is and always has been one of our more liberal politicians.  She's not changing her tune because of Bernie, that gives him and his influence much more credit than is deserved; instead, this is how she's always been.  Compare her voting record to that super-awesome, super-liberal voting record you Bernie-bots love to bring up: she voted 93% the same.  Wow, what a difference.

> many bi partisan political analysts consider him more center left than anything

Examples?  Every analysis I've ever seen on him shows him being the most liberal senator in office.  I have never once seen anyone try to label him as even close to center, not even the Bernie-bots.  Are you even sure you want to make this claim?  A large part of his draw to the average Bernie-bot is how liberal he is, trying to move him closer to center so he appeals to the average voter would make him less appealing to his core base.

> Also you mention him being too supportive of gun control

Please work on your reading comprehension.  I never said he was too supportive of gun control, I simply said he got an F from the NRA and that alone is why a lot of conservatives wont vote for him.  I know he's not actually supportive of gun control, his voting record and own statements show that.  It's one of the reasons I wont vote for him.

> That is SO SAD to read. Literally the stupidest and most defeatist way to vote

As opposed to "My candidate matches my views exactly but has zero chance at winning so I'll vote for him and hope the warm-fuzzies I got for voting Bernie survive the next 4 years of President Trump"?  For fucks sake, I'm being realistic here, something you Bernie-bots are entirely incapable of.  ***BERNIE HAS NO CHANCE AT WINNING***, Hillary does, and if I agree with Bernie 99% of the time and I agree with Hillary 98% of the time it's not a wasted vote and it's not a defeatist attitude.  Christ almighty you people get all melodramatic and preachy whenever someone dares express anything not in-line with your Bernie personality cult.

> Bernie is a better candidate for the general election because he actually has strong grassroots energy behind him.

I'll believe it once I actually see some polls and numbers showing this.  Until then, the polls are showing exactly the opposite, so for now it's just another Bernie-bot fantasy based on a very, *very* naive idea of how politics and this country works.

Long story short, I'll continue to vote for Hillary in both the primary and national.  I've spent the last 2 months since my original post researching Bernie some more and, despite me also being a democratic socialist, he is not my candidate.  We differ on a few key and important issues, such as gun control, he's lacking pretty much every bit of experience a president needs (foreign policy, national security, trade, etc) and his list of accomplishments in his decades long federal career is *very very* slim.  Wikipedia best sums it up:

> Republicans have described Sanders as "an ineffective extremist" for successfully sponsoring only one law and 15 amendments in his eight terms in the House.

For once I agree with the Republicans.Are you enjoying the puppet show?Do you still feel this way, even now? Through huge crowds, a lead in NH, and increasing support?

The movement is happening. Bernie Can Win.

Yes, 100%.  Only a very, very small part of the argument I made had anything to do with his grassroots support.  The rest of my argument, the bulk and the core of it, has not changed and I'm not at all surprised to see another Bernie-bot completely unable to process that.  

I'd expand on what I mean, but I think I already spelled it out clearly enough, so if you're unable to understand it the first time I don't think you'll get it the second time.  Anyway, one thing I've learned since I originally posted this is that it's absolutely pointless to get into a discussion with a Bernie-bot, especially one so desperate for attention they smugly troll 4 month old threads in the Hillary sub.  With them, it's absolute obedience and reverence or you're wrong.  Funny, I was thinking the same thing about supporters of Hillary and Trump.

Actually, I came "trolling" here because I wanted to become educated as to the thoughts on the other side. With me, I am trying to see if it would be worth trying to vote for Hillary if she is the nominee or if I should stand my ground and vote Bernie regardless- or even- gasp- a Republican. I am a swing voter, after all.
I am going out of my way to understand what exactly about Hillary you support, and I am being met with distaste and contempt.

What is your background? Are you a middle/upper class white male? Are you hetero-normative? I am none of those, and Hillary's dodgy and inconsistent positions do not reflect my environmental and big business concerns.

I also want, for context, an idea of your state of origin and level of education. You seem to write well enough and carry an air of superiority. Poli-sci and history major? New York? (Just guessing)

On a more personal note, someone I, eh, know, worked with Hillary as first lady and specifically noted her presence in person as rude and unprofessional. I realize this does not affect cold judgments based on voting records, but when it comes to those I am more inclined to support Bernie's straightforward history to Hillary's Janus-faced theatrics. (That speech in South Carolina? Ugh.)
What I do understand is that your tone towards discussion is bitter, curt, and not helping to win me (i.e. the swing voter) over. You seem to feel defeated for discussion, as if you are talking to children while I am trying my best to be engaged.

At least I can thank you for responding fast.
Sorry, but you're going to have to look elsewhere for a discussion.  Like I alluded to, I've had this discussion many times since Bernie even considered joining the race and not once have I met someone that *genuinely* wanted a real discussion on the matter.  Sure, I've met a few that claimed to want more information, or wanted to "become educated about the other side", but in every single situation it turned into a "Bernie can do no wrong, therefore you are wrong to not accept him" and "I accept Bernie, you do not, therefore something is wrong with you let's see if we can discover what it is" type debate/sermon.  It's not a discussion to learn about the other side, it's a discussion to learn about why the other side hasn't yet accepted Bernie as their own personal candidate.  Your initial post seems to indicate you're looking for much the same; it's the same Bernie-bot stuff I saw in /r/politics before I unsubscribed. 

I apologize if I am wrong about your intentions. 

You say I act like I'm talking to children, and you'd be right.  Bernie supporters, by and large, don't understand the intricacies of the American political system, they completely ignore any issues that don't bode well for their candidate and they are completely swayed by an ineffective populist that tells them exactly what they want to hear.  They are idealistic, not pragmatic.  I'm not saying Bernie supporters are actual children, I know he has supporters of all ages, but I am saying most of his supporters are acting as if this is their first election cycle.  Nor am I saying *I* fully understand our political system, I don't, but I don't think you need to be Nate Silver to see Bernie has some serious issues with his candidacy, many of which are impossible for him to overcome at this point.

Hillary is my candidate.  I've done my research and she is the candidate I'm looking for.  Bernie is not, and on a policy and experience level I disagree with him enough that even if Hillary dropped out I would end up backing someone else.  I have my reasons, and they are mine.  The only information I will tell you about myself is that most of your assumptions about me are wrong.  I know Bernie-bots have some kind of mission to convert everyone to their side, but I really don't care about doing the same for whoever I'm voting for; it's a personal decision and everything I could tell you about either candidate is already public record.

That said, I did have some thoughts on Bernie's chances of winning the primary.  I clearly explained them in my last few posts in this thread, and none of those issues changed just because he's leading in a state that historically favors old, white, liberal men.

I'm done with Bernie, and I'm done with his supporters.  If you like socialized losses and privatized gains.  Vote Hillary.I think Sanders would have at least as good a chance as Hillary in the general. Please don't vote for a worse candidate because you're afraid your countrymen aren't ready for a better one. I do believe Bernie would be a great President.  He's got the right ideas and I think he'd last a lot longer than anyone else, even Obama, before he folds under the realities of the situation he and the country is in and starts compromising himself.  

On pretty much every issue I agree with him, which makes sense because I'm a democratic socialist atheist myself.  If there's anything I don't like about him policy-wise (that I've seen so far) it's he's really weak on foreign policy.  Yes he's made some votes I agree with, votes that few others had the balls to make, but when it comes to *making* policy or *explaining* policy he's weak, which makes sense since he just doesn't have the experience to back it up.  Hillary, though...there isn't a single candidate that *could* get into the race that is stronger or has more experience.  Foreign policy has arguably been one of the Presidents most important jobs (it's one of the few areas the President can pretty much go it alone) and it's definitely going to play a huge part in the next 4-8 years (Russia, ISIS, the middle east, etc).  I'd feel more comfortable putting someone into the White House that I know can handle the pressure and intricacies of dealing with hostile (or peaceful) nations, even if they don't represent me 100% on other issues.

Anyway, we'll see how it's looking as the primaries get closer.  I live in a state with a later primary so by the time I get to cast my vote the country will already have a good idea who's getting the nomination.  If a miracle has happened and Bernie is actually doing well and the Democratic party, the media and the American people appear to have suddenly started leaning far enough left then I'll vote for him.  If he actually does get the nomination then I'm definitely voting for him in the general election.

Until then, though, above all else I'm a realist.  I'm putting my support behind Hillary.  Sorry.But we've all been socialists since at least 2009

http://politicalderby.com/2011/04/21/a-majority-of-us-are-all-socialists-now/1. Bernie 1941; Biden 1942; Clinton 1947. They're all old. So what?
2. Too soon to say, given his surge.  Don't nip it in the bud - let this movement blossom across the nation.1. Bernie is the oldest, though.  Older than John McCain was when he ran and everyone on *both sides* made his age an issue.  Older than Reagan when he dealt with Alzheimer's.  He'd be the oldest president ever elected and would be in his 80's if elected for a second term.  His age *is* an legit issue and it will become a liability for Bernie as this election continues.

2. His surge is more like a ripple compared to what he's up against.  Polls still show him far, *far* below Hillary.  It's been 2 months since OP asked his questions and he's still polling on average below Biden, someone that hasn't even said he's running.  Not saying he won't start gaining momentum at some point, but, well, "too soon to say"Starting operation impending dooo... Oh, hey there.Bernie looks like he's in fantastic condition. He was a marathon runner and his BMI looks terrific compared to lumpy Hillary.  Physical fitness matters.  

Don't the Republicans want us to keep working anyway? Consider the ages of the Supreme Court Justices.  Ginsburg 82; Scalia 79; Kennedy 79 in a few weeks;  Breyer 76.  Four out of nine are over 75, and consider that they are appointed for life.  
 
Also, please direct us to your source that Bernie is "polling on average below Biden."  I'm interested in seeing those polls.  Starting operation impending dooo... Oh, hey there.The American voting public, Bernie's opponents and the media don't really care about your subjective opinion on his health.  The fact is, he's old, older than we've ever elected, and that's historically been a problem.  It *will* be a liability.

As for the data:

My mistake, my data was a week or so old, he's averaging around the same as Biden now.  I'm not even madJPOnion, you're contradicting yourself.  You said that his age (by implication, his health) is an issue in this election.  Then you say "The American voting public, Bernie's opponents and the media don't really care about your subjective opinion on his health."

Make up your mind.  Voters do care or don't care about age and the implicated health issues associated with age? ...how did I contradict myself?  I said his age and, yes, by implication his health would be an issue.  You said, in what appeared to be an attempt to handwave it away as a non-issue, that he looked to be in fantastic condition.  I said nobody will care about ***your*** subjective opinion on his health, it'll still be an issue people will care about.

In other words, your opinion he's fine won't matter and won't be enough to make this issue go away.Shh. Don't talk. Just go.
