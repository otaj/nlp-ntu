"Donald Trump's campaign remarks about Mexican immigrants represent a play to the worst parts of society, Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday. Speaking at a reception marking Hispanic Heritage Month, Biden laid into the businessman turned GOP front-runner -- naming him twice -- as reverting to ""xenophobia"" in a play for votes.",Y
"As for China, he??ll argue that China is ??stealing?? jobs from the US (there??s the indignation)??and if he were in office, he wouldn??t let the nation ??have its way with us.??",N
"Enter Donald Trump, who seems to have an innate mastery of this process. He is an ad-man??s dream, a political consultant??s perfect plaything.",N
"In the end, it??s a calculated image that makes him an incredibly appealing candidate.",N
"Using many of his own words, we explain why The Donald is dangerous as well as boorish",Y
"Could be ""DIE"" or ""DJT"" for Donald J Trump? Or maybe he's just DTF and wants us to know it",N
This is really dumb. What's the joke? That a guy was cheering too loudly for Trump?,Y
I think it was vintage Trump. It wasn't a defense-policy speech the way we've come to think of them in the modern presidential campaign era. There were no specifics on really anything.,Y
"One thing American voters are signaling to the political establishment and the policy establishment working in Washington is that maybe they don't care. ... Maybe the voters are saying this is a whole different election. Maybe they're saying, 'It's just too early, gosh darn it, give us a break",Y
"Yes, that's true about his vague tax proposals. But I disagree with the no-bs statement, because he is all bs. Whenever he is asked for details of any plan, he says, ""When I tell you, it's going to be really great! The greatest!"" But he never says what it is.",N
"He's invoking language that is reminiscent of a time when America was deporting LEGAL citizens of color. ""Keep the families together."" Tread carefully.",N
Trump only mentions Mexicans. That's the problem. He's picking one group. That's what makes him a bigot whether he is or not in general,Y
Disgust is a genetic characteristic of Trump supporters.,N
"They are both disgusted and disgusting. They love hate. They are the pigs in 1984, Orwell's novel",N
Trump is a great speaker. But so was the little corporal from Bavaria.,Y
"I agree that Trump's campaign is a ""movement"", albeit in a more physiological sense. It certainly reeks of something",N

"Anybody who says as intolerant words as those should be laughed at, and that's pretty much what history will do",N
"There is nothing to apologize for. Many bad people are pouring through. I'm not saying just Mexican, many bad people. All you have to do is ask the border patrol,"" Trump said. ""I don't have a racist bone in my body. I'm just exposing things that everybody knows is happening, but nobody wants to talk about.",N
"'Wow, I've been advertised to rather than letting me decide who the best character is. I've been manipulated to vote.",N
No let Trump do that and open another golf course and when that fails dump it all by going bankrupt.,N
Exactly. Donald Trump is incredibly offensive and people need to call him out on it.,Y
Are you sure that he is the one who is incredibly offensive?,N
Donald trump SHOULD be laughed at for some of his comments. But I don't know if this one particularly is one of them,Y
He has just got something going on with his ability to perform in front of the crowd.,N
I'm having a really hard time taking seriously the opinions of people who would rather be lied to than offended.,Y
It's going to be pretty easy for Trump to belittle Clooney's comments.,Y
Trump comes off as intolerant but he's not wrong about illegal immigration from Mexico needing to be dealt with.,Y
"And Donald Trump's response will be: George Clooney is an OK actor, and he's not even good looking!",Y
"And you truly think Trump cares more? Has any less? He has made a living being rude and arrogant. Atleast Clooney is good looking, and smart.",N
Donald Trump supporters love him because he says exactly what they want to hear. Immigrants will be thrown out of the country.,Y
Anyone who supports illegal immigration should be laughed at. Anyone who sticks their head in the sand and refuses to admit the negative effects of illegal immigration should be laughed at.,N
"Nobody supports illegal immigration, but anyone who believes that Donald Trump will make Mexico pay for that great wall should be laughed at.",N
Get your head out of the sand and use whatever intelligence you have to realize that there is no simple solution.,Y
Donald Trump is playing you.,N
Trump is elected he should do all he can to screw the Hollywood Liberals,N
"Trump cares soooooo much about your opinion that he forgot to react...sorry George, you are truly irrelevant.",N
everything you say is true---if George is against Trump then people know Trump is the way to go.,N

And this is why I adore Clooney - Trumph is plain despicable,N

the Clown Trump and you all are the jokes,Y
"We can only hope. He needs to go away, he is not good for America image",Y
I'm glad that Donald Trump said what he said. This goes to show everyone how soft and pathetic America's people are becoming.,Y
"Trump's a knuckle-dragger, and so are you. He has a message of aggression and blustering, and you eat that up.",Y
Donald is a pig but he is a pig that can be bought. We like that.,Y
"Trump is disgusting, obnoxious, sexist, racist, and ridiculous - I'm ashamed of anyone who supports his run for President",N
Trump seems to know how a deviant thinks,N
So you people think that a president should attack any reporter that ask them a tough question,Y
"This does not mean he hates neither all women, nor all men by those statements. It just means those PEOPLE have not earned his respect",N
"Actually, I think it's Trump who's always having a period.",N
"Trump's too cowardly to admit what he meant by ""or wherever.""",Y
SHE IS A LOSER GO TRUMP,Y
He is just running for President to draw attention to himself. Like he doesn't have better things to. This man is such an idiot,Y
He doesn't want to actually do the work involved in being president. He just wants to win. He is an utter fool.,N
"Okay, then, he behaves foolishly and has no clue that he does",N
Liberals LOVE Trump! His sideshow is sinking any chance of a Republican winning.,N
He is brilliant and the liberal media is running scared because of it! Go Trump!,Y
Keep it coming Donald. Politics are usually boring,N
But a funny person is not necessarily what we want in a president. And I can see him being a foreign relations nightmare.,N
Mr. Trump is a perfect representative for those who comprise the Republican party.,Y
GO TRUMP GO!!!,N
I fail to see the big deal about his comment!! This is so silly!,N
"Yo Donald, let's hear how your bazillion bankruptcies have impacted our economy.",N
TRUMP IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING,N
I'm Canadian but am really worried for the USA if Trump gets in office,N
"If Trump ever got into office, you will be welcoming one more Canadian. I've already vowed to move there.",Y
I'm loving me some Trump right now,N
"And I Hate Him! I know he's crazy, but I am too!",N
YOU ARE A DAMN LOUD MOUTH MORON IDIOT,N
Upon further review we need Trump's leadership,Y
"Neither did I, he's an idiot. Us Dems will win again! Go Hillary!",Y
"Hopefully when Mr. Trump is elected President and the leaders of Iran chant ""death to America"", Mr. Trump will say ""you know what, how about death to Iran"" and bombs them off of the face of the earth.",Y
I realize if Trump is in there we will gain our respect back that that fool obama spent on his pal arab nations.,N
But supporting trump along with you!,Y
"We know you're the same troll! Calm down, this isn't the polls, although you morons probably think it is!",N
"If we can survive a Muslim born in Kenya President we could survive Trump if he made it. The way I look at it, at least he was born here and shares our traditions and doesn't hate America!",N
Trump is crazy. Kelly is a feminist bitch and crazy too,Y
Trump for top dog!,N
Trump always pulls out the face cardTrump always pulls out the face cardTrump always pulls out the face cardTrump always pulls out the face cardTrump always pulls out the face card,N
Trump takes this wealth principle to an extreme. He not only refuses to dwell on his past failures,Y
"They don??t recognize failure like the rest of us. They only see it as a stepping stone to their success. These people are professional comeback artists, so when they fail, they frame the setback as a bump in the road as opposed to an outright failure",N
"Donald Trump, from a psychological standpoint, lives in an alternative universe that he??s created for himself. It??s a psychological universe where losses are overlooked and gains are inevitable",Y
He's got amazing hair,Y
He thinks global warming is a Chinese conspiracy,N
"In fact, he's the world's greatest climate scientist",N
It's Shame D.Trump is total arrogant Asshole,N
"Trump is getting angry about Cher saying ""horrible untrue"" things about Republican candidates, When he did the same thing about the Mexican people.",N
DUMP TRUMP I'M DYING.,Y
Trump doesn??t align with tfm??s new political correctness position,N
"Trump is kinda a nut. He didn??t even promise that he wouldn??t run as a third party canidate, and if he did Hilary would win. He would just be splitting the republican vote.",Y
See I think you are wrong. I think Trump can beat Hillary. History shows that whenever a radical republican takes on a radical democrat republicans usually win.,N
The fact that he??s got no regard for what spills out of his mouth or his thumbs makes him the man to fix Washington,Y
Trump as president is a joke. I like the attitude but he just talks big game without going in to specifics like Rubio or Paul can. He would make an awesome press secy though.,N
"That said, I agree with her - Trump is an imbecile",Y
I've felt embarrassed for Mr. Trump many times. This is the first time I felt sorry him.,Y
