--- To compile Word2Vec ---
- gcc ./5.4_5.5/5.4_5.5/word2vec.c -o word2vec
- gcc ./5.2/NLP 5.2/distance.c -o distance
- gcc ./5.2/NLP 5.2/regularities.c -o regularities
- gcc ./5.2/NLP 5.2/word-analogy.c -o word-analogy
--- Run codes for section 5.2 ---
- ./word-analogy GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin
- ./word-analogy corpus.bin  
- ./distance corpus.bin
- ./regularities corpus.bin
--- Build models for section 5.4 and 5.5 ---
- Build a binary corpus file with word2vec
- Download Weka at http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka
- Download TextBlob at https://github.com/sloria/textblob-aptagger/tree/master
- Use TextBlob to POS tags training and testing sets
- Open Weka, Choose Explorer, choose an arff file as training set
- Choose FilteredClassifier as classification model
- Under FilterClassifier options, choose LibSVM as the library and StringToWordVector as filter
- Choose an arff file as test set
- Press Start and note down the performance	
- Data files (*.arff, *.csv) at ./5.4_5.5
