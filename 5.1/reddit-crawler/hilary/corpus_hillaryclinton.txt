The Hillary Clinton supporters are waving those blue glow sticks. They're also pretty much everywhere else in the room. [**@ppppolls**](https://twitter.com/ppppolls):

This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/trey-gowdy-just-elected-hillary-clinton-president-20151023) reduced by 93%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> With Thursday&#039;s interminable, pointless, haranguing, disorganized, utterly amateurish attempt at a smear job, the Republicans and their tenth-rate congressional attack schnauzer, South Carolina&#039;s Trey Gowdy, got people feeling sorry for Hillary Clinton.

> Her shtick at one point devolved into questions about a) the fact that Hillary went home on the night of the attacks, instead of staying in the office, and b) the idea that Hillary waited too long to personally call the survivors of the Benghazi attack.

> Again, the implication here isn&#039;t just that Hillary was indifferent to American life, and cared more about the lives of Libyans than Americans.

Did they not recognize that going after President Clinton with manufactured scandals did nothing but strengthen him and his supporters?  We were inoculated with "scandal fatigue" two decades ago, and now they're giving out booster shots.It's because the Republicans and specifically the Congressional Republicans have killed their leadership. They don't have a playbook, just moldy old talking points that were irrelevant three years ago.Watched the whole hearings, she handled it very well & professional for 11 hours long. Meanwhile Trump and Carson refused and even threaten to boycott CNBC debate if its longer than 120 minutes. What pathetic losers.The most relevant point being that the most recent previous iteration of this poll was Sanders +1More good news for Hillary! Yes, she should pick up a good portion of the <1% who were supporting Chafee.

In all seriousness, his supporters, like Jim Webb's, were probably more centrist, so they would in fact be more likely to move to Clinton over Sanders, so you're completely right, I just wanted to snark.I completely agree that these supporters will default to Hillary, but honestly, its such a low number. I can't say this surprises me. He seems like a genuinely nice guy, but he was polling so low. He seems like such a genuine guy, it was kind of wrenching to see the media bludgeon him about how futile and worthless it was of him to waste his time running. Even if it was true.Omg actual comments finally in here.She was on *fire* during this hearing. Loved almost all of her responses.

I'm a Sanders supporter, but I have immense respect for Hillary, especially regarding the amount of BS she has to put up with on a regular basis. 

Funny how this Benghazi hearing fits so snugly in line with the 2016 elections. These people don't care about Chris Stevens or his family. They care about the votes.That's funny because I'm a Sanders supporter too, and I've been pretty unhappy about Hillary's use of private email. But boy did those Republicans make you root for her, so much so that I'm actually enthusiastic about her candidacy. Incidentally, she's most likable when she doesn't try to be likable.>[Clinton clears major hurdle after measured Benghazi testimony](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/clinton-clears-major-hurdle-after-measured-benghazi-testimony)https://gifsound.com/?mp4=https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video/CR84RNYWwAQ3gq-&v=Oz_-VaTHpc8&s=68My reddit-less roommate made this, I'm posting on her behalf.She really did a great job today. 11 hours and she held it together.https://youtu.be/QEzhxP-pdosI have been watching on and off all day: been watching now since 5pm and it's almost 9pm. This is shameful. When will this debacle end? She is a great speaker and she can handle anything they throw at her.Yes, she is. The Benghazi hearing is already backfiring on the GOP. >Alan Reische told New Hampshire Source he had "hemmed and hawed" over backing Clinton until watching her testimony. He wrote that she showed "enormous courage, patience and dignity."

>"Her response to this inquisition has dispelled any doubts I might have had about her candidacy," Reische wrote. "I'm on board with her."Just you.>FappyDavisJr

/u/ checks outTrump supporter here.  I think Hillary looks [fabulous with long hair](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1313564/thumbs/o-HILLARY-CLINTON-HAIR-570.jpg?5), especially when its [long and curly](http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/tdy-121026-hillary-clinton-03.photoblog500.jpg)
