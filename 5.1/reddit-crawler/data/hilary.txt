To be fair, there are a lot more viable options for CEOs to donate to on the Republican side.  They're *not* going for Sanders, so there's really only one Dem that they could get behind.  
On the Republican side they are splitting their money up in between Rubio, Bush, Kasich, and probably a few even going for any of the zany quartet of Cruz, Florina, Trump, and Carson.
\>Says she didn't do most of her work by email

\>Has an entire private server to store her email and classified documentsShe looked presidential and they looked juvenile. If you want to know what a Clinton administration will look like, loop the hearing for 4 years straight.Her troubles never existed. This is a a witch hunt that has gone nowhere.The FBI investigation suggests otherwise.I'm not interested in suggests.  When you have something post it. Until then quit wasting my time.You clearly haven't read any of the posts in this subreddit. We've spent months documenting the illegalities and rule-breaking involved in Clinton setting up a private homebrew server and email for all of her government communications. When you read them, get back to us with an informed response to the posts. No sense in talking unless you do your homework.No, just like the republicans you have spent months making suggestions. With Hillary running for president any proven allegation would be acted on.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/10/justice-department-rules-hillary-clinton-followed-/Sorry but that ruling concerns deletion of her personal emails. Try again. :)Exactly, everything they investigate turns up nothing.Her personal emails were never the subject of an investigation. Strike 2. :)I laughed for a solid 3 minutes over the notion that HillC would get 10 minutes in a cell, much less 10 years. Bam isn't going to allow a fellow Dem, regardless of who, to go under the gavel, PERIOD. PERIOD. It simply isn't going to happen. You and I do not get to play by the same rules (lack of rules?) as HC and the Dem elite. They simply don't give a flying fuck about the Constitution, the US Code, or any other law you care to name. Bam is a Constitutional Scholar? HAH!  All that means is he knows how to beat it. And frankly, we deserve the bullshit they create for allowing them to get away with it all through the slick willy era. USA = FUCKED. At most she'll get charged with a misdemeanor. But even that could end her candidacy for president.The Dem voters simply do not care. They would vote for a ham sandwich with a D by its name. Dems vote Dem first, no matter.Her response was absolutely disgusting and misdirection. She's only against TPP when voters are listening. She's no longer acting apologetic about this.  She's kinda acting cocky about it now.  When she heard Bernie say he was sick of hearing about her emails,  she thought that meant that she was off the hook. It's so f-d up that the GOP managed to blow what should have been an open-and-shut case of misconduct (minimum) and possible felonies (maximum).This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/12/d-n-c-officer-says-she-was-disinvited-from-debate-after-calling-for-more-of-them/) reduced by 86%.

Hill? just another day in paradise.  drip drip drip.Honestly, it sounds like she is really unhappy with her life. Part of me things that after the Lewinsky scandal her marriage ended behind the scenes, and since getting a divorce would be political suicide her and Bill agreed to stay together for political reasons.

One question I really don't know the answer to is why does she even want to be president? Is it just a power grab? If she hates it that much maybe she would be happier retiring and getting out of the spotlight.

In some ways I almost feel bad for her. I certainly would not want to be in her place.[Based on this article](http://harpers.org/archive/2014/10/stop-hillary-2/) it seems like the whole of her marriage was based in large part on political calculation.You could be right. Or maybe she's just a hateful bitch with no respect for anyone. There's no way to know, because she's a politician and she's great at hiding her true self.
The hillary portrayed in this story sounds like a sociopath, I'm not surprised.I just came here to post a link to that story.  If it's true, it reveals her true personality and why Democrats should support Bernie Sanders, instead.  How you treat other people when the cameras are not on speaks volumes.

There may also be a new Bill "bimbo eruption" brewing.  Rumor has it that he has a smashing blond mistress nicknamed "Energizer" by the Secret Service.  Of course, that's completely irrelevant to the merits of a candidate.  However, it's just one more distraction that the Democratic candidate could do without.HAHA fantastic!So the socialist spends money more wisely than his less-frugal adversary...hmmmm.....I always knew Bernie was more likeable and now I'm more than certain he'd run the country's finances better than the ~~Hillster~~ huckster!!!!GOD, she sucks. The woman who could possibly run our country everybody! **slow claps**Nobody is waiting for baited breath.Note, it is the donors who are urging.  They are urging because lovable Joe is more controllable than Bernie.  They are terrified of Bernie.Obama would prefer his loyal VP to any other Dem. Is that a help to his primary run and eventual electability?The article lost credibility the moment they blamed Obama for the troop withdrawal from Iraq. It is a matter of fact that the withdrawal was negotiated and finalized by George W, Bush.

Edit - I hate Hillary as much as the next objective observer. > the withdrawal was negotiated and finalized by George W, Bush.

The Obama administration actually wanted a status of forces agreement.

The finger, it says, should be pointed not at Mr. Obama but at those who pressed him to attempt training Syrian rebels in the first place — a group that, in addition to congressional Republicans, happened to include former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.All these points are on the dot.XPost Subreddit Link: /r/American_Politics

^^[Contact](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=OriginalPostSearcher) ^^| ^^[Code](https://github.com/papernotes/Reddit-OriginalPostSearcher)This is why people don't see her as trustworthy. Even if this is much ado about nothing, she's handled everything about this in a very suspicious way.Great postok' let us take a walk down this path which appears to suggest something positive for team Clinton.  the argument here appears to be that team Clinton paid for the maintenance, administration, and support for the clintonemail server, and as such this server arraingment did not cost the government and taxpayers anything to use this external server operation.  Team Clintons message here is "all is good here".  

now let us transport ourselves to the current state of the cost of the clintonemail server, and that cost is that we (the taxpayers) are paying for a team of forensic experts to analyze the clintonemail server to minimally determine if there we national security exposures due to the clintonemail server.

how much is that team of experts costing ?  is team Clinton paying for the cost of the forensic team ?  Having a lead 5 months before the primaries begin and a rapidly sinking public image doesn't mean a lot either.With email, like any other unencrypted communication, you don't need access to the server anyway, just any part of the communications path to it for whatever communications traverse it.  If the server is the most secure server in the world and the first hop router is cracked then it's game over.That seems . . . huge.

Interesting, I wonder who the superdelegate is.Bill Clinton!! /s :)this is pretty scary.  clintons believe they are above the law.  clintons should know best that they are targets of every nation and to place confidential emails on a separate server is pretty scary.  hopefully no one else was able to access this info but you never know.  look at wikileaks, etc.    there is a very good chance clinton faces charges.  Dems are using Biden as insurance policy, if not Trump wins this easy.I agree. I fear that a Clinton presidency will be as bad as or almost as bad for the rule of law as the Bush-Cheney years.I agree with you.  Bernie and Biden are just fine although I worry about Bernie's health.

All the best,I'm not so scared of her winning (v. Bernie) so much any more these days.How can we trust Hillary to be our president if she can't keep secrets now. As far as I'm concerned, she's a national security threat.Rasmussen [isn't really reliable.](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/which-polls-fared-best-and-worst-in-the-2012-presidential-race/?_r=0)Like any other source, understand the biases and they become a useful input.If Biden joins he will pull Clinton votes and accelerate her loss to Sanders. Dammit, this man is insightful.  I'm sure there's a ton I don't agree with him on, but he's certainly worth listening to.Yeah, Dick Morris is all over the place. In 2012, he bet all his credibility on Romney winning and claimed that all the pre-election polls were dead wrong. So some times he is on point and other times he might as well be talking about UFOs. lolA lot of people in the echo chamber believed Romney would easily win.  I guess it also depends on how much faith they put in the election fraud efforts.Title 18-2071;

As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States. Great video. He also says that a grand jury could indict just for using her private served, not only deleting them.To big of an "if".I'm not a lawyer but to me I don't understand how this whole thing will end without any indictments, maybe not of Clinton herself but at least people working with or under her.> people working with or under her.

I was under the impression that she had the one private email server at her home, which she has now begrudgingly handed over to the FBI, likely to avoid an actual subpoena. The one she deleted half of the emails from.

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/American_Politics/comments/3fjly9/joe_biden_adviser_says_vice_president_is_90_in/I will not vote for Hillary. If Bernie is not nominated i will vote 3rd party, probably Jill Stein of the Green party again. Hillary is a sociopath just like most republicans.Yup. If America doesn't want to vote smart then it has to feel the the smart of it's dumb choice. I'm fairly confident that whoever the GOP nominates I'll have to vote for Hillary.  The field is pretty scary. That and being in Florida I don't really have the luxury of throwing in a protest vote for a third party.That's because they were edited to be disturbing. And any competent leader should know this. So we have two options here:

1. She is incompetent.

2.  (the more likely reason) She is lying.This seems to be the case for several reasons.  Can't handle 2 e-mail address? Incompetence or lying.   Refuse to state position on important issues?  Incompetence or lying.  I'm starting to think she's a DINO.In other words, "You really aren't going to like what I have to say about it, so I won't say anything until it's too late for you to change your mind."

I imagine it like buying a used car, and you ask: "Do the brakes work good?" and getting the response "Well, I guess you'll find out when you're driving it home, right? Sign here, please." Sharron Angle gave a similar response when she was running against Senator Reid.  It was delivered better by Clinton but the point remains clear:  You don't get to know until it is too late.  I read that as Feel The Bern.[Ah, the memories!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-05TLiiLU)i cringedDisgusting!  She's on record supporting the TPP, numerous other sellouts to big business, so what makes anyone think that she's got our interest in mind?

So naturally, everyone is against the Keystone (because it DOESN'T create permanent jobs and it'll cost more than it gains after just one spill!) so Hillary just has to lie and scapegoat, hope it goes away and she can become president and give it the go-ahead.

Thanks, Obama, for even having this on the table still!Why is the Keystone pipeline such a big deal when we have many similar pipelines already in use over much of the same geography?  Is it just a symbol or is there something actually amiss with this particular pipeline?There are [numerous concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Pipeline#Keystone_XL_controversies)Flawed impact studies and the risk of leakage is SOP for pipelines.  While I agree that these are concerns for all pipelines I don't see why this one gets singled out.  In what way is this pipeline worse than the ones already in place?Even if you disregard all the concerns (which I don't), installing the pipeline makes oil easier to get and an even more attractive option, increasing our reliance on it. Liberals want to stop increasing our reliance on oil in any way possible.That's how I see it too.  One side of me says a pipeline (or another one as it were) is safer than exploding trains but if we're going to be symbolic about this pipeline representing big-oil and all things un-green then I'll accept the totem for what it is.  I'd just like someone to spell it out to be sure.Even if you are going to get the oil from Canada, it would make more sense to process it and use it in Canada as local as possible.  This pipeline moves it all the way through the United States and some of which will go back.  It's all that extra energy being used that doesn't have to be used to transport it for processing it.  It is one of the worst imagined plans even if you are in favor of using that oil.3 Big reasons, really?I'm writing the following for my own sanity:

I have told so many people on Reddit this for months since the Democratic primary run started and I've been fought on this over and over again as people say "but look at her poll numbers!". 

No. Swing states have been been trending red and Clinton is losing ground among independents who control the victory in swing states. The election is decided by swing states and Hillary Clinton cannot win enough of them to win the presidency. She'll take Minnesota, Colorado, and probably Nevada and Michigan. Maybe Florida if Jeb Bush isn't running. Otherwise, she'll lose all of the other states: North Carolina, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia, New Mexico, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. All of these states have been trending red and Hillary Clinton isn't well liked by as many people as her supporters think. If she is the democratic nominee, she will lose.  

Fuck it just feels good to hear.Clearly not more electable.[deleted]Thanks!While this makes me happy, I'm wondering why Sanders was left out, especially since his numbers are on the rise.

Oh wait, it's probably because his numbers are on the rise.Again, no specifics. Just talk.I watched her speech. 

Your title is spot on. Everything with her is just a bunch of feel-good ideas being said, without anything to show for it. Lots of talk, but nothing concrete.Whoa.  Hang on here.  Does this mean that Hillary . . . lied?Seems reasonable to me.Why? What's wrong with shaking hands with someone with a "White" tattoo!? For all we know it's his last name. What's the big deal? To me this seems disrespectful.Posting it was a mistake. Deleting it made it an issue.We don't know what that tattoo means and it's prejudiced to assume.

The real problem for the Clinton's is that it is just one more unpleasant reminder of how filthily they campaigned in 2008.



"(CNN) — In what appear to be the New York senator’s most blunt comments to date regarding a racial division in the Democratic presidential race, Hillary Clinton suggested Wednesday that “White Americans” are increasingly turning away from Barack Obama’s candidacy.

“I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on,” Clinton said in an interview with USA TODAY.

Clinton cited an Associated Press poll “that found how Senator Obama’s support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me.”

“There’s a pattern emerging here,” she said.

Exit polls from Tuesday’s primaries in Indiana and North Carolina show Clinton won about 60 percent of the white vote in both states. That percentage is down from the Ohio primary on March 4, in which Clinton won upwards of 65 percent of the white vote. Meanwhile, Clinton garnered 63 percent of the white vote in Pennsylvania on April 22.

Speaking with the paper, Clinton rejected the notion her comments were racially divisive in any way.

“These are the people you have to win if you’re a Democrat in sufficient numbers to actually win the election,” she said. “Everybody knows that.”

Obama spokesman Bill Burton called Clinton’s statements “not true and frankly disappointing.”"



"The third-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives and one of the country’s most influential African-American leaders sharply criticized former President Bill Clinton this afternoon for what he called Mr. Clinton’s “bizarre” conduct during the Democratic primary campaign.


Representative James E. Clyburn, an undeclared superdelegate from South Carolina who is the Democratic whip in the House, said that “black people are incensed over all of this,” referring to statements that Mr. Clinton had made in the course of the heated race between his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Senator Barack Obama."

It was construed as racist by many people, and the Hillary camp didn't want there to be any confusion. For example on this sub, we remove comments that can be construed as sexist, but aren't 100% explicitly sexist, because it's the best policy.Oh but wow. Is that the kind of president she is going to be? Is Hillary's not a prejudiced and reactionary response to what may well be a completely innocent word? It isn't s confederate flag. It isn't a swastika. It's just the word "white."

It's Ok to have picture on your Twitter of you shaking hands with a supporter who has a tattoo of the name of a color on his arm.

#"white"tattosdon'tmatter.
A sad reflection on our country is that we will still vote for a candidate we don't trust.Lying about people trusting her...The same old song and dance from the 90's: 

Smoke?  Check.
Mirrors?  Check.
Blaming right-wing conspiracy?  Check.Outright lying here:

>Clinton said she turned over all the emails -- including some which show her using a secured fax machine, or asking for iced tea during meetings -- that had anything to do with public business, and that she broke no laws in sticking with one device because she's not technically savvy.

This is just complete bullshit. It takes infinitely more technological savvy to setup and use a freaking personal private email server! Not to mention that the State Department itself has said she hasn't turned over some of them, and that they can prove it. I just can't believe all these lies. Wouldn't want to squander that billion dollar war chest on stupid wages, now would we.Excellent idea!Why exactly do you believe an unconstitutional bill enforcing a private organization's rules on the nation with large fines is an excellent idea?Come hell or high water, the mainstream media is going to vote as a block for their favorite porcine pantsuited phony Progressive. Hillary can abuse these girls like a hopelessly drunken husband and they will crawl back begging for another beating they mistake for love and affection. Who else have they got? The pathetically partisan press are as repelled by Republicans as a hydrophobic hound is adverse to water. Hoary Hillary knows this better than even the roped off journalists.Ha! Just the opposite of Sanders. Sanders will talk to the press all the time, take questions. It makes you wonder why one candidate has to have everything very controlled and scripted, and the other (Sanders) can talk to anyone at anytime, and has nothing to hide.http://www.frugal-cafe.com/public_html/frugal-blog/frugal-cafe-blogzone/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/homeland-security-message-get-back-into-your-free-speech-zone-political-poster.jpgOh no!

Now she might pretend to take Bernie's stances on the issues, negating much of his advantage!And Bernie will be too much of a gentleman to point it out?Probably.

It would make me want to crowd-fund my own attack ad against Hillary, though.[deleted]If we can let R think he can't win and let them bolster his position against Hillary, R may very well be driving their replacement where he wants to be.[deleted]She wouldn't be popular enough to win reelection by as much of a margin as I think she'll win the first time. But I think she'll retain enough votes from the slim block of undecideds in the middle from many not wanting to vote the first female president out of office, as well as the immense incumbent advantage she'll have. How can anybody actually believe she'll fight for LGBT rights when in office?[deleted]You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but all you need is to fool enough of the voters to win an election.There are sexists everywhere, even among Democrats unfortunately. :-(

Goooo Hillary! Wooo!You forgot the /s tag. It would be sexist to vote for somebody just because of their gender and better candidates are available.What exactly do you feel is sexist?You. Misogynist would be a more appropriate term.Interesting. Care to share a reason? I consider myself a pretty fair, non-misogynistic guy. It's actually pretty insulting to be called that.It seems pretty arrogant to me that you would argue the only reason anyone could possibly dislike Hillary is because of her sex.

I dislike Hillary for a great many reasons,--her policy record, her hypocrisy, etc.--but her sex isn't one of them.I'm British. I watched [this](http://news.yahoo.com/video/presidential-hopeful-bernie-sanders-talks-202700207.html) interview with him yesterday. He seems like a very good candidate. I would love to see him get elected. Sadly though I think there are too many powerful people with vested interests to keep him out.Like [Obama](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/9167332/Barack-Obama-microphone-gaffe-Ill-have-more-flexibility-after-election.html), she'll have much more latitude after the election.>I believe marriage is not just a bond but a sacred bond between a man and a woman. I have had occasion in my life to defend marriage, to stand up for marriage, to believe in the hard work and challenge of marriage. So I take umbrage at anyone who might suggest that those of us who worry about amending the Constitution are less committed to the sanctity of marriage, or to the fundamental bedrock principle that it exists between a man and a woman, going back into the mist of history as one of the founding, foundational institutions of history and humanity and civilization, and that its primary, principal role during those millennia has been the raising and socializing of children for the society into which they are to become adults.[deleted]I do see the the solid reasoning behind the strategy you describe. If  republicans send Jeb out there I think it's pretty smooth sailing for Hillary, however I think it would be even smoother for Biden or another decent Dem. too true/u/PaulG1974

There's nothing intrinsically wrong with someone saying "this system has problems" even as they've benefited from it, and I think that at least some voters will be able to understand that distinction. It sounds like however that you think this will be a complete deal-killer in the general election if she gets that far. So, conditional on her winning the nomination, how likely do you expect it is that she'll lose the general election? I agree that benefiting from laws you disagree with is absolute fine. I don't agree with so much hypocrisy she spews regarding policy, legal and otherwise. I am. to just talking about her own earning, or the shadyness of the TWO Clinton foundations.   I was at her UCLA speech when she lambasted businesses that don't pay interns, and essentially take advantage of the free workforce. yet the Clinton foundation has about 100 full time interns they don't pay then a cent. A very small percentage  get a meager clothing or travel allowance that is like 2000 for internships over four months. While not lead by example for a change? The  other  major US foundations like Gates and Ford not only pay interns competitive salaries , they do matching charitable donations and  housing and education  subsidies. The Clinton's do none of this. Why not lead from the front for a change? Even the email server, how dare she potentially jeopardize the security of our country for her own privacys sake? 

I don't think anything is a deal killer for Hillary in the general election. The system is currently built for democratic wins, especially with the horrible financial gap between upper middle class/rich to the lower middle class and poor.  I think she is a strong favorite to win like 2-1 vs bush. Probably a lesser favorite against Rubio or Walker.  Maybe 60-40. However I think Joe Biden or another solid Dem  without the Hillary baggage would be a far stronger favorite. I will say if she blows this election she will go down as the worst presidential candidate of our time. Literally she will be the "anti Bill Clinton" as we all know he was a great candidate and a solid president.  If she blows this one coupled with the 2008 failure vs a complete unknow when she was virtually ordained the Dem candidate she will make the wrong kind of history.Ah, I see. I'm essentially in agreement with you regarding the email and the Clinton Foundation. I was focusing purely on the primary issue brought up in the OP. I have been summoned!LOL Joe get in there baby! [deleted]Exactly. The targeting of Hillary and Obama for the Benghazi attack is just a Republican scheme. My **big** problem though is Hillary's destruction of evidence, and setting up the server in the first place! Shows some intent to hide something.[deleted]Yeah, I've noticed that too.Well. You just got another follower, so I hope it's gonna even out.. I won't comment anymore because I think Bernie's stance on negative attacks are spot on and not needed. Also, I imagine the circlejerk (which I participate in) here is even worse than in /r/SandersForPresident. But I will gladly upvote a post if the link is a serious source with a good point, because the fact that america might have another Clinton vs Bush is fucking terrifying. :)This is interesting because I had previously assumed that Vox was all in for Hillary Clinton. Nice to see that they're at least attempting to explore some different perspectives.THIS SO MUCHHow is she panning to pay off all the favors (implied or explicit) that she's having to make in order to reap all this cold, hard cash in only 4 years?!? When she loses the primary, is she going to turn over all this money to the winner or is it going straight into the Clinton Foundation?This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/06/04/activist-behind-hillstarter-crowdfunding-site-afford-meeting-hillary-clinton-speaks/) reduced by 70%.

It will in any case.If you watch the video this comes from, Sanders actually never says this - they just edit the conversation in such a way as to make it seem like he made that the direct implication. Sanders is going to run into this sort of thing a lot in the campaign I think. He want to refrain from negativity, but since the central theme of his campaign is implicitly critical of Hillary, and the media is determined to only convey the horse race aspect, the result is going to be stuff like this, where Sanders says something about an issue, Hillary is bad on that issue, and the media just skips to claiming that Sanders is criticizing Hillary with as little talk as possible about the issue. This is problematic because if people aren't able to relate criticism of Hillary to substantial issues, then they are going to assume that the criticism is not something that they should care about. This article at least conveys the issue on the table though.The link: http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/21/politics/clinton-foundation-speech-income/index.html

Did you think you were in /r/conspiracy? Because you're not...I didn't make this up, it is factual data that can be verified. Denial is not a river in Egypt.I looked at the natural news donor list, seems legit, what's your point?She did favors for them in exchange for donations to her foundation including approval of weapons sales as Secretary of State and her husband got huge speaking fees from the bankers, corrupt as the day is long. Quid Pro Quo. Denial is not a river in Egypt.Just to back up my so called conspiracy. You HillaryBOTs should really pay closer attention to who you are backing.

Hillary was pretty funny in that interview. I guess I don't see the big deal in her once being against it. At one time, we all were in some way, either passively or aggressively. But we learn more about others and ourselves and hopefully change for the better.

I see that as a positive: someone who realizes their wrongdoings and changes to make it right.

The media can run with this "story" as much as they want, but they have to know they're just as guilty as she was/is."I want something completely equivalent to gay marriage in everything but name" to "I want gay marriage" is not even a *bit* of a different stance than today. It absolutely is.Your at 150 subs! Keep on going!153 Subs! Congrats girls!Looking forward to another 4-8 years of manufactured scandals!Headline:

>Hillary Clinton: Let’s Be Honest, Black Men In Hoodies Are Scary

Actual quote:

>“I mean if we’re honest, for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear,”

OP, this is a bullshit claim and you know it.  You couldn't find anything bad she actually said, so you had to post a lie?If you don't think that quote is dambing, then you're the asshole. Not the blogger, not OP.Can anyone find a link to the full interview?Yea, I haven't heard this speech, but the fact that they cropped it down to only 13 seconds, intentionally cropping out any context leads me to believe the person who did this *doesn't want* us to know the rest, because it's probably pretty reasonable.

She's not wrong. Racism is still going strong, and there are white people who are afraid of black guys in hoodies.  I'm pretty sure the rest of her speech was something along the lines of "and that's wrong, and we need to do something about that."I'm an average looking white guy.  I have 1 jacket thats from a bands concert.  But it looks like a gang related jacket from the 90s.  Took me a few months to figure out why when I'd walk down the sidewalk people would cross the street to avoid me.  I was offended.  I dont wear that jacket anymore.Not the most tactful thing for her to say.I thought her corporatist/bank loving tendencies were well known.  I see this is getting down-voted.  

You don't want to know stuff like this is getting said about Hillary?  Only one way to deal with stuff like this and you can't even start if you don't know about it.   Don't turn this sub into the Fox news channel for Hillary, that's what I'm saying.  No surprise at all.  She's pumped full of bank and corporate money.  She is for TPP, the pipeline, Wall Street.  She's not for the citizenry.I'm a Sanders supporter already but I had no idea she had that kind of money. Makes me wonder where he's lived.And what, Hillary, is a fair economy?
That educated people earn more money than the uneducated?
Flipping burgers pays less than an accountant?
Yep, that is fair.
So, blah, blah "FAIR" ... but somehow she is neglecting the fact that there are so many under-educated people. How can she provide FAIR, without providing a solution to the education problem in this country? Giving people something they haven't earned, doesn't sound fair, does it?Explain to me this: Why would you be so lacking in taste right out of the gate? Are you 12? 

I'm voting for Bernie but, just saying...So edgy.Yes, a very progressive thinker. Hillary will go down - Obama is just waiting for the right moment to throw her under the bus. I'm far more interested in seeing the actual poll and how the questions were asked verses reading a reporters interpretation. Fair, next time I'll link to the results themselves.Seriously would like to how anybody could support her,  there are so many red flags with herShe's tough, smart, pragmatic, and liberal. She's been a Democrat standard bearer for 30 years. So....there ya go.Hillary yesI couldn't have said better. It's almost like yet another politician is only in this industry for themselves.

weird.Almost like ...?Natural News... the bane of my Facebook experience.  One completely bullshit article after another plastered by gullible idiots.

Protip:  Natural News is "fake news."  None of what they talk about on that site has any basis in reality.  It doesn't matter how many "likes" you get, oatmeal won't cure your cancer.Highlights from NaturalNews include the "facts" on how we need *more* CO2 in the atmosphere, how eating MSG is literally a sin against God, and that one time he encouraged his followers to murder scientists working in plant transgenics. If you want to go and criticize Hillary, this seems like one of the absolutely stupidest ways to do so.

You are using an absolutely terrible source. Natural News is just awful. There's also nothing intrinsically wrong with GMOs at all. If you want to talk about specific problems with some things that Monsanto has done as a corporation that's one thing.

I'm curious though RAndrewOhge, what probability do you assign to Hillary winning the primary, to her winning the general? If anyone REALLY remembers Benghazi-it DID matter, not to mention the history of "iffy" dealings during the Rose Law Firm years and the subsequent Arkansas Governorship and Clinton Presidency, then there SHOULDN'T be ANY chance at all.

But we ARE talking about the typically partisan AMerican voter-so, it's a "toss of the dice".

As to Monsanto, GMO's remain full of potential issues, not least of which is the E-Coli-based Bacteriophage used to carry the traits and it's totally UNTESTED provenance. Then there's Glyphosate, which is emerging as even more dangerous to the health of all life, as well as the biosphere.

As a Corporate Entity, they have redefined the Art of Dirty Tricks.
> If anyone REALLY remembers Benghazi-it DID matter, not to mention the history of "iffy" dealings during the Rose Law Firm years and the subsequent Arkansas Governorship and Clinton Presidency, then there SHOULDN'T be ANY chance at all.

Can you explain why you think Benghazi matters at all? Can you also explain why you consider Hillary Clinton responsible for her husband's Presidency, and if you do consider her responsible why she doesn't also get credit for 8 years of peace and prosperity?

> As to Monsanto, GMO's remain full of potential issues, not least of which is the E-Coli-based Bacteriophage used to carry the traits and it's totally UNTESTED provenance.

Huh? E. coli is not a bacteriophage. A bacteriophage is a type of virus. Words have meanings. It might help to take a basic biology course before deciding you can make decisions about these things.

> Then there's Glyphosate, which is emerging as even more dangerous to the health of all life, as well as the biosphere.

Glyphosate is not a GMO. It is a broad spectrum herbicide. 

Do a little research other than just following mainstream narratives...it's just NOT that hard anymore.I'm going to leave aside for now that I disagree with just about every single sentence in that piece, aside from noting that many countries have had women as leaders and done just fine (Britain and Israel both come to mind). 

I'm more curious on your testable claim:

> Never in the history of this great nation has a woman become POTUS and I don’t foresee it happening this upcoming election. Men will rise from all cracks of the earth to make sure that this doesn’t happen. I’m sure of it.

How sure is sure? What fraction of men do you expect to "rise up" and vote for another candidate? Hillary lost 8 years ago. What makes you think that she can or even should win now? What has changed?Hillary lost the primary 8 years ago to a strong candidate. She's playing a much more careful ground game this time and her field of other candidates are much weaker.

Let me ask you two questions then: a) what probability do you assign to her losing the primary? b) what probability do you assign to her losing the general if she wins the primary? ~15%, ~45%That doesn't seem unreasonable, and I suspect much better calibrated than /u/ManLogic (although they haven't provided estimates yet). Actually the first one is off. 10% is much more consistent with the oddsmakers these days.I didn't say it was correct, I said it didn't seem unreasonable. I think a reasonable person could guess anywhere from about 5-20% for the first one. Out of curiosity, what's your range for the second one?I assign around a 65% chance that Hillary will win the general. However, I have a slight history of overconfidence in political predictions, so 60% seems safer. To be clear, that's your unconditional probability, right? So you think if she wins the primary she'll be something like a 70-80% favorite?No that's my probability for her winning the general without any given. I assign a high probability for her winning the primary, on the order of 90% or slightly higher.  There is a decent chance that Hillary might win the primary but I seriously doubt she will become President. She will be almost 70 years old. Do we want an old woman in her 70s running the country?> There is a decent chance that Hillary might win the primary but I seriously doubt she will become President. She will be almost 70 years old. Do we want an old woman in her 70s running the country?

We've had Presidents that age before. You seem to care much more about her gender and seem to think that many people will have an active problem with her gender.

I'm curious, in your blog post you wrote that: 

> Never in the history of this great nation has a woman become POTUS and I don’t foresee it happening this upcoming election. Men will rise from all cracks of the earth to make sure that this doesn’t happen. I’m sure of it.

Does that mean you expect her to lose the popular vote by a large amount as many men show up to vote against her? Yes. Many people will have an active problem with her gender. Men AND women will vote against her. Women want to feel safe and secure while as men are both physically and emotionally stronger than women.Suppose someone offered to bet you $50 that conditional on Hillary being the Democratic primary nominee, she will win at least 43% of the popular vote in the general. Would you take that bet on the side of having less than that percentage? No. I would not bet anything based on percentages. I would bet solely on a win or loss. There's much room between now and the election so we'll see how things pan out. Hillary will not get my vote.Curious, you wouldn't bet on percentages but you claim there will be a mass turnout against her. Can you explain your reasoning?

(Also for reasons I don't understand your userpage is showing as non-existing, I'm not sure why that's the case.) Also, curious assuming you would just bet on the general result, what percentage would you assign to Hillary losing the general given that she wins the primary? Is this article for real? It reads like it's from the Onion. People may prefer Hillary to Sanders also because they genuinely prefer more moderate positions on many issues and would rather a moderate Democrat be in charge than a far liberal. Still looking for answers?Number 2 isn't a non-answer, it's reality.  He's an admitted socialist.  He doesn't hide it.  That alone will kill his chances in a general election, and unless come primary time he's polling significantly higher than Clinton there's no way the Democrats will put all their hopes, dreams and money behind him.  

The sad fact is up until only a few decades ago there was very strong and very successful propaganda against anything to do with socialism.  I'm guessing you're in the 30 or below age bracket so you don't remember it.  For the majority of Americans, though (the vast majority of those that actually vote), the mere mention of the word is enough to either scare them or anger them.  All the GOP needs to do is run TV spots showing clips where Bernie says he's a socialist and they've won.  Recent Gallup polls support this: More than half of the country still hold a negative view of the word socialism, even among Democrats, and only a third of Americans have a positive view.  Bernie not going to get every single one of those 1/3, so you still have an uphill battle convincing a *lot* of Americans that Bernie is their guy *and* that their long held, deeply instilled belief about socialism is wrong.  I guarantee you the mass media, left or right, won't help you educate people (even on the difference between socialism and democratic socialism) so it's entirely a grassroots effort.  

You can show them individual policies all you want, but if you think that's enough to make them overcome the label then you put too much faith in the average voter.  Look at Obamacare for one of many examples; the vast majority of Americans support it when you explain it, but when you mention the word Obamacare support, even from the same people, plummets.  Same when you explain liberal / left-wing policies; people support them, up until they find out it's something considered liberal.  Imagine how bad it'll be when people find out you've been trying to sell them socialist policies and ideas.  

Even if he didn't say he was socialist, his policies are too left-wing for the majority of Americans to consider right now.  Obama won two hard fought elections with people calling him socialist, communist, liberal and all sorts of other words they thought were nasty.  Even when it came down to just his policies a very large amount of voters were hesitant or even turned off because he was too liberal for them.  Obama, compared to Bernie, is a centrist at most.  I don't see America, or the Democratic party, suddenly shifting so far left that Bernie becomes viable.  

The simple, unfortunate truth is he is unelectable in the current political climate.  He's a damn good candidate and I wish it weren't the case, but in my opinion he's the 2016 version of Kucinich.  He's a populist politician with his heart in the right place.  He's willing to say what needs to be said, and he genuinely believes it.  But America, and the media, won't take him serious.  Kucinich's downfall, the point where the media stopped taking him serious, was I think his UFO comment.  Bernie will be his socialism.  The country just isn't ready for it.

Also, I don't think Number 1 is a non-answer, either.  Bernie is already far older than Reagan was at inauguration, and he was the oldest President we ever had.  Hillary is even getting flak for being too old, as was McCain when he last ran, and they're all younger than Bernie.  It may not be an issue to you, but the media and his opponents will certainly make it an issue.  Those dictators and warlords you mentioned, by the way, they weren't democratically elected...do you think if they ran in an actual election their age wouldn't come up as a possible issue?

Another possible issue:  He's got an F rating from the NRA.  I know a lot of voters (I come from a conservative family) that wouldn't vote for him for that reason alone.  If they thought Obama was coming after their guns...

Edit: Yet another possible issue: Bernie is Jewish, but he's never talked about his beliefs so many, many people consider him atheist. The atheist community, such that it is, by and large consider him one of their own. Historically (and according to recent polls) neither being Jewish or being atheist is a good thing for a presidential candidate.

Anyway, as for Clinton, I'm not supporting her because I think she's the best candidate.  I'm not supporting her because I feel she represents me the best.  I'm supporting her because she's the best and most representative of my views out of all the possible candidates on either side that have a realistic chance of winning.This answer(s) from JPOnion is so flawed... First of all, nationally 48% of Americans say they would vote for a socialist (not just democrats, but ALL Americans). Also overall democrats are very much far left leaning this election cycle, this is why we are seeing Hillary making more far left/progressive talking points every day, and basically matching Bernie in his talking points (even though she doesn't truly stand behind them). This isn't 2008 and its not the 90's, this country is very much ready for a progressive.  Second of all, Bernie Sanders isn't far left on all positions, and many bi partisan political analysts consider him more center left than anything.   Also you mention him being too supportive of gun control, but he has a more moderate stance on gun control than Hillary Clinton. "Anyway, as for Clinton, I'm not supporting her because I think she's the best candidate. I'm not supporting her because I feel she represents me the best. I'm supporting her because she's the best and most representative of my views out of all the possible candidates on either side that have a realistic chance of winning."  That is SO SAD to read. Literally the stupidest and most defeatist way to vote... If you looked at the progressive movement in this country you would realize Sanders had a chance, and regardless you should vote for who you think represents you best, THATS WHAT THE PRIMARY IS FOR! Even if you put your vote behind Bernie and he doesn't win the nomination, it doesn't mean you can't support Hillary in the general election. This sort of defeatist attitude is exactly what is making American politics go down the drain.

Lastly, there are simply more democrats and progressives in this country than there are republicans. With good energy behind a  candidate and a good grassroots get out the vote effort, no Republican will stand a chance. In that sense, Bernie is a better candidate for the general election because he actually has strong grassroots energy behind him. Unlike Hillary who continues to drop in the early primary state polls, and has very little unpaid energy behind her. This cycle in particular, any Democrat who gets the nomination has a strong chance of winning, especially given how scattered the GOP is right now.What a very appropriate username.  You've perfectly encapsulated the fantastical, fuck-you facts attitude the Bernie-bots have been flooding /r/politics with lately.

> First of all, nationally 48% of Americans say they would vote for a socialist 

You might want to re-read this poll and what it means.  It doesn't say 47% (that's the actual number) would vote for a socialist, it says *only* 47% would *consider* voting for a socialist.  It also says 50% of Americans would *not* even consider voting for him at all.  In other words, unless this number drastically changes more than half of Americans will not even consider voting for him.  Additionally, you fail to mention that in this same poll "socialist" is the *worst* trait a candidate could have, below being atheist or muslim.  Try as you might, you Bernie-bots can't twist this around to somehow be a positive.

> Hillary making more far left/progressive talking points every day

That's also because Hillary is a progressive candidate on her own.  Hillary is hawkish on a few issues, but by and large *facts* and *history* show she is and always has been one of our more liberal politicians.  She's not changing her tune because of Bernie, that gives him and his influence much more credit than is deserved; instead, this is how she's always been.  Compare her voting record to that super-awesome, super-liberal voting record you Bernie-bots love to bring up: she voted 93% the same.  Wow, what a difference.

> many bi partisan political analysts consider him more center left than anything

Examples?  Every analysis I've ever seen on him shows him being the most liberal senator in office.  I have never once seen anyone try to label him as even close to center, not even the Bernie-bots.  Are you even sure you want to make this claim?  A large part of his draw to the average Bernie-bot is how liberal he is, trying to move him closer to center so he appeals to the average voter would make him less appealing to his core base.

> Also you mention him being too supportive of gun control

Please work on your reading comprehension.  I never said he was too supportive of gun control, I simply said he got an F from the NRA and that alone is why a lot of conservatives wont vote for him.  I know he's not actually supportive of gun control, his voting record and own statements show that.  It's one of the reasons I wont vote for him.

> That is SO SAD to read. Literally the stupidest and most defeatist way to vote

As opposed to "My candidate matches my views exactly but has zero chance at winning so I'll vote for him and hope the warm-fuzzies I got for voting Bernie survive the next 4 years of President Trump"?  For fucks sake, I'm being realistic here, something you Bernie-bots are entirely incapable of.  ***BERNIE HAS NO CHANCE AT WINNING***, Hillary does, and if I agree with Bernie 99% of the time and I agree with Hillary 98% of the time it's not a wasted vote and it's not a defeatist attitude.  Christ almighty you people get all melodramatic and preachy whenever someone dares express anything not in-line with your Bernie personality cult.

> Bernie is a better candidate for the general election because he actually has strong grassroots energy behind him.

I'll believe it once I actually see some polls and numbers showing this.  Until then, the polls are showing exactly the opposite, so for now it's just another Bernie-bot fantasy based on a very, *very* naive idea of how politics and this country works.

Long story short, I'll continue to vote for Hillary in both the primary and national.  I've spent the last 2 months since my original post researching Bernie some more and, despite me also being a democratic socialist, he is not my candidate.  We differ on a few key and important issues, such as gun control, he's lacking pretty much every bit of experience a president needs (foreign policy, national security, trade, etc) and his list of accomplishments in his decades long federal career is *very very* slim.  Wikipedia best sums it up:

> Republicans have described Sanders as "an ineffective extremist" for successfully sponsoring only one law and 15 amendments in his eight terms in the House.

For once I agree with the Republicans.Are you enjoying the puppet show?Do you still feel this way, even now? Through huge crowds, a lead in NH, and increasing support?

The movement is happening. Bernie Can Win.

Yes, 100%.  Only a very, very small part of the argument I made had anything to do with his grassroots support.  The rest of my argument, the bulk and the core of it, has not changed and I'm not at all surprised to see another Bernie-bot completely unable to process that.  

I'd expand on what I mean, but I think I already spelled it out clearly enough, so if you're unable to understand it the first time I don't think you'll get it the second time.  Anyway, one thing I've learned since I originally posted this is that it's absolutely pointless to get into a discussion with a Bernie-bot, especially one so desperate for attention they smugly troll 4 month old threads in the Hillary sub.  With them, it's absolute obedience and reverence or you're wrong.  Funny, I was thinking the same thing about supporters of Hillary and Trump.

Actually, I came "trolling" here because I wanted to become educated as to the thoughts on the other side. With me, I am trying to see if it would be worth trying to vote for Hillary if she is the nominee or if I should stand my ground and vote Bernie regardless- or even- gasp- a Republican. I am a swing voter, after all.
I am going out of my way to understand what exactly about Hillary you support, and I am being met with distaste and contempt.

What is your background? Are you a middle/upper class white male? Are you hetero-normative? I am none of those, and Hillary's dodgy and inconsistent positions do not reflect my environmental and big business concerns.

I also want, for context, an idea of your state of origin and level of education. You seem to write well enough and carry an air of superiority. Poli-sci and history major? New York? (Just guessing)

On a more personal note, someone I, eh, know, worked with Hillary as first lady and specifically noted her presence in person as rude and unprofessional. I realize this does not affect cold judgments based on voting records, but when it comes to those I am more inclined to support Bernie's straightforward history to Hillary's Janus-faced theatrics. (That speech in South Carolina? Ugh.)
What I do understand is that your tone towards discussion is bitter, curt, and not helping to win me (i.e. the swing voter) over. You seem to feel defeated for discussion, as if you are talking to children while I am trying my best to be engaged.

At least I can thank you for responding fast.
Sorry, but you're going to have to look elsewhere for a discussion.  Like I alluded to, I've had this discussion many times since Bernie even considered joining the race and not once have I met someone that *genuinely* wanted a real discussion on the matter.  Sure, I've met a few that claimed to want more information, or wanted to "become educated about the other side", but in every single situation it turned into a "Bernie can do no wrong, therefore you are wrong to not accept him" and "I accept Bernie, you do not, therefore something is wrong with you let's see if we can discover what it is" type debate/sermon.  It's not a discussion to learn about the other side, it's a discussion to learn about why the other side hasn't yet accepted Bernie as their own personal candidate.  Your initial post seems to indicate you're looking for much the same; it's the same Bernie-bot stuff I saw in /r/politics before I unsubscribed. 

I apologize if I am wrong about your intentions. 

You say I act like I'm talking to children, and you'd be right.  Bernie supporters, by and large, don't understand the intricacies of the American political system, they completely ignore any issues that don't bode well for their candidate and they are completely swayed by an ineffective populist that tells them exactly what they want to hear.  They are idealistic, not pragmatic.  I'm not saying Bernie supporters are actual children, I know he has supporters of all ages, but I am saying most of his supporters are acting as if this is their first election cycle.  Nor am I saying *I* fully understand our political system, I don't, but I don't think you need to be Nate Silver to see Bernie has some serious issues with his candidacy, many of which are impossible for him to overcome at this point.

Hillary is my candidate.  I've done my research and she is the candidate I'm looking for.  Bernie is not, and on a policy and experience level I disagree with him enough that even if Hillary dropped out I would end up backing someone else.  I have my reasons, and they are mine.  The only information I will tell you about myself is that most of your assumptions about me are wrong.  I know Bernie-bots have some kind of mission to convert everyone to their side, but I really don't care about doing the same for whoever I'm voting for; it's a personal decision and everything I could tell you about either candidate is already public record.

That said, I did have some thoughts on Bernie's chances of winning the primary.  I clearly explained them in my last few posts in this thread, and none of those issues changed just because he's leading in a state that historically favors old, white, liberal men.

I'm done with Bernie, and I'm done with his supporters.  If you like socialized losses and privatized gains.  Vote Hillary.I think Sanders would have at least as good a chance as Hillary in the general. Please don't vote for a worse candidate because you're afraid your countrymen aren't ready for a better one. I do believe Bernie would be a great President.  He's got the right ideas and I think he'd last a lot longer than anyone else, even Obama, before he folds under the realities of the situation he and the country is in and starts compromising himself.  

On pretty much every issue I agree with him, which makes sense because I'm a democratic socialist atheist myself.  If there's anything I don't like about him policy-wise (that I've seen so far) it's he's really weak on foreign policy.  Yes he's made some votes I agree with, votes that few others had the balls to make, but when it comes to *making* policy or *explaining* policy he's weak, which makes sense since he just doesn't have the experience to back it up.  Hillary, though...there isn't a single candidate that *could* get into the race that is stronger or has more experience.  Foreign policy has arguably been one of the Presidents most important jobs (it's one of the few areas the President can pretty much go it alone) and it's definitely going to play a huge part in the next 4-8 years (Russia, ISIS, the middle east, etc).  I'd feel more comfortable putting someone into the White House that I know can handle the pressure and intricacies of dealing with hostile (or peaceful) nations, even if they don't represent me 100% on other issues.

Anyway, we'll see how it's looking as the primaries get closer.  I live in a state with a later primary so by the time I get to cast my vote the country will already have a good idea who's getting the nomination.  If a miracle has happened and Bernie is actually doing well and the Democratic party, the media and the American people appear to have suddenly started leaning far enough left then I'll vote for him.  If he actually does get the nomination then I'm definitely voting for him in the general election.

Until then, though, above all else I'm a realist.  I'm putting my support behind Hillary.  Sorry.But we've all been socialists since at least 2009

http://politicalderby.com/2011/04/21/a-majority-of-us-are-all-socialists-now/1. Bernie 1941; Biden 1942; Clinton 1947. They're all old. So what?
2. Too soon to say, given his surge.  Don't nip it in the bud - let this movement blossom across the nation.1. Bernie is the oldest, though.  Older than John McCain was when he ran and everyone on *both sides* made his age an issue.  Older than Reagan when he dealt with Alzheimer's.  He'd be the oldest president ever elected and would be in his 80's if elected for a second term.  His age *is* an legit issue and it will become a liability for Bernie as this election continues.

2. His surge is more like a ripple compared to what he's up against.  Polls still show him far, *far* below Hillary.  It's been 2 months since OP asked his questions and he's still polling on average below Biden, someone that hasn't even said he's running.  Not saying he won't start gaining momentum at some point, but, well, "too soon to say"Starting operation impending dooo... Oh, hey there.Bernie looks like he's in fantastic condition. He was a marathon runner and his BMI looks terrific compared to lumpy Hillary.  Physical fitness matters.  

Don't the Republicans want us to keep working anyway? Consider the ages of the Supreme Court Justices.  Ginsburg 82; Scalia 79; Kennedy 79 in a few weeks;  Breyer 76.  Four out of nine are over 75, and consider that they are appointed for life.  
 
Also, please direct us to your source that Bernie is "polling on average below Biden."  I'm interested in seeing those polls.  Starting operation impending dooo... Oh, hey there.The American voting public, Bernie's opponents and the media don't really care about your subjective opinion on his health.  The fact is, he's old, older than we've ever elected, and that's historically been a problem.  It *will* be a liability.

As for the data:

[Nationwide opinion polling for the Democratic Party 2016 presidential primaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries)

[2016 Democratic Presidential Nomination](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html)

My mistake, my data was a week or so old, he's averaging around the same as Biden now.  I'm not even madJPOnion, you're contradicting yourself.  You said that his age (by implication, his health) is an issue in this election.  Then you say "The American voting public, Bernie's opponents and the media don't really care about your subjective opinion on his health."

Make up your mind.  Voters do care or don't care about age and the implicated health issues associated with age? ...how did I contradict myself?  I said his age and, yes, by implication his health would be an issue.  You said, in what appeared to be an attempt to handwave it away as a non-issue, that he looked to be in fantastic condition.  I said nobody will care about ***your*** subjective opinion on his health, it'll still be an issue people will care about.

In other words, your opinion he's fine won't matter and won't be enough to make this issue go away.Shh. Don't talk. Just go.
So, what was all the rambling about? It seems to be little more than language that didn't mean much of anything.welcome hillary 2016, all fluff with no substance.To my understanding, Illegal Immigrants seem to be a bit of an issue. Don't really see what legit latino citizens have to worry about, if they're in they're in. Mexico though, it seriously needs to get its shit together, I mean hell. What they have to deal with in Mexico? I'm surprised none of them are taken along with the Syrians as refugees, hahaha... When drugs and gangs are out, Mexico could probably do pretty well for itself and not have to rely sneaking off over to the US to make some cash. Feel the problem is bad for both Mexico and the USA respectively, really wish Mexico were in a better way so it'd be a non-issue for either of them.I think she's right - Sanders would be better than Obama.She should get used to wearing that orange.[deleted]Ummm because it's HIGHLY ILLEGAL to store/send/receive TOP SECRET HIGHLY CLASSIFIED data outside of government control. Hillary went out of her way to BREAK THE LAW. What's your malfunction that you don't care about that? [deleted]ya, wot difference does it make mate, rightThey were not classified when sent.That *was* the story. As of today they have found several were classified when she sent them.I guess it is good to get this resolved early in the election cycle.Sounds interesting.  I might look that book up.I want money out of elections, economic equality, police accountability, robber baron banker accountability, radical justice reform, real climate action, the end of the denial of science, the end of private prisons, the breakup of the too big to fail banks, the end of gitmo, the promise America will hold those in power to account for their lawlessness, Jail tortures not whistle blowers, campaign finance reform, repeal citizens united, rebuild our infrastructure.

I could go on and on and on, but I can make this easier for you.  I am going to vote for Bernie Sanders because Clinton will triangulate all these issues into a pile of shit...My primary concern is that Hillary Clinton will ruin this country's future with her pandering to rich contributors and that our democratic system has created an environment that allows for campaigns like hers to stifle the democratic process by diverting the national attention away from candidates that really care about the people's interests, like Bernie Sanders, through the use of manipulative and subversive tactics. Running expensive ad campaigns is one example.

Especially considering she's so detached from the average American youth that she has no clue what their concerns are.Tell him to come work for the grassroots movement, we could use him. Grassroots for Bernie Sanders. If not here's a quote "vote Bernie".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFLFBhNeE1Y&feature=youtu.be

Bernie has broken 20% in the polls and has a much stronger platform.Lol. Hillary is doing just fine on her own on this one. Yes I am sure that she would be. Her decision unlikely had nothing to do with Joe. And being Secretary if State may actually provided fuel against her.

I think the real question here is would Joe be running if Hilary was not.I didn't love the songSo cute!
So adorable. The little accent!!Says the woman who makes $250,000 for a ten minute talk?It's sad that she's quoting these statistics. I'm not sure if they were really "the best avaliable" at the time of the speech, but recently we've seen remarkable consensus that videogames do not cause violence. How can anyone listen to this trash and not obviously feel like she is a fool? " This woman is an obvious fascist more interested in restricting freedom than actually working with groups riddled with violence to promote strong family connections and support groups in order to reduce stress and causes of real violence while giving struggling parents the tools they need to grow together
.   We need to keep up the momentum of the past six years. We can't afford to kill healthcare for millions of families or hand the country over completely to Wall Street. If she could preserve the progress we've made, she'd already be a success.

But knowing Hillary and her passion, she won't be content to stop there.[deleted]:DFantastic video. It's the exact opposite of this characterization of Hillary as out-of-touch or presumptive. Her ad puts other people front and center; she keeps her appearance for the end.From the looks of it... NobodyI personally can't wait. As a lifelong liberal older guy I look forward to her being president. I also like her family. Honestly I totally agree with you guys. It was just a joke about how underwhelming this thread is. I came here expecting for it to have exploded.I made it a while ago. Have just let it sit. Not sure what so do with it. How are you doing?Me! This sub is gonna blow up in the coming weeks/months. She's definitely the frontrunner for the DNC nomination.

Personally, I look forward to a healthy debate and discussion on her polices. Let's just remember that, while this is a sub for a democratic candidate for the US President, we welcome all forms of discourse on the complex system that is the election of the US Presidency.

As to your concern of the lack of interest of Secretary Clinton's announcement, this sub has mostly been dead due to the lack of commentary on a race that really hasn't begun until these last couple of weeks. Hopefully, we'll see a rise of content and interest in the coming months as election season kicks off.

Edit: grammarOopsLolSince casting my first vote ever in the 2008 primary! She's my hero and I don't know of anyone more qualifiedSanders?I am.  I was all ready for her in 2008 until Obama came in and took the nomination.  While I'm glad to have had him as president the last 8 years, I'm still looking forward to Hillary.Who's ready?  Hillary's ready.  Don't f'k this up for her, America.I'm pretty ready for Hillary.  I think the country is too.  And I think she is ready for the Presidency.

We'll see.

> Her shtick at one point devolved into questions about a) the fact that Hillary went home on the night of the attacks, instead of staying in the office, and b) the idea that Hillary waited too long to personally call the survivors of the Benghazi attack.

> Again, the implication here isn&#039;t just that Hillary was indifferent to American life, and cared more about the lives of Libyans than Americans.

Did they not recognize that going after President Clinton with manufactured scandals did nothing but strengthen him and his supporters?  We were inoculated with "scandal fatigue" two decades ago, and now they're giving out booster shots.It's because the Republicans and specifically the Congressional Republicans have killed their leadership. They don't have a playbook, just moldy old talking points that were irrelevant three years ago.Watched the whole hearings, she handled it very well & professional for 11 hours long. Meanwhile Trump and Carson refused and even threaten to boycott CNBC debate if its longer than 120 minutes. What pathetic losers.The most relevant point being that the most recent previous iteration of this poll was Sanders +1More good news for Hillary! Yes, she should pick up a good portion of the <1% who were supporting Chafee.

In all seriousness, his supporters, like Jim Webb's, were probably more centrist, so they would in fact be more likely to move to Clinton over Sanders, so you're completely right, I just wanted to snark.I completely agree that these supporters will default to Hillary, but honestly, its such a low number. I can't say this surprises me. He seems like a genuinely nice guy, but he was polling so low. He seems like such a genuine guy, it was kind of wrenching to see the media bludgeon him about how futile and worthless it was of him to waste his time running. Even if it was true.Omg actual comments finally in here.She was on *fire* during this hearing. Loved almost all of her responses.

I'm a Sanders supporter, but I have immense respect for Hillary, especially regarding the amount of BS she has to put up with on a regular basis. 

Funny how this Benghazi hearing fits so snugly in line with the 2016 elections. These people don't care about Chris Stevens or his family. They care about the votes.That's funny because I'm a Sanders supporter too, and I've been pretty unhappy about Hillary's use of private email. But boy did those Republicans make you root for her, so much so that I'm actually enthusiastic about her candidacy. Incidentally, she's most likable when she doesn't try to be likable.>[Clinton clears major hurdle after measured Benghazi testimony](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/clinton-clears-major-hurdle-after-measured-benghazi-testimony)https://gifsound.com/?mp4=https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video/CR84RNYWwAQ3gq-&v=Oz_-VaTHpc8&s=68My reddit-less roommate made this, I'm posting on her behalf.She really did a great job today. 11 hours and she held it together.https://youtu.be/QEzhxP-pdosI have been watching on and off all day: been watching now since 5pm and it's almost 9pm. This is shameful. When will this debacle end? She is a great speaker and she can handle anything they throw at her.Yes, she is. The Benghazi hearing is already backfiring on the GOP. >Alan Reische told New Hampshire Source he had "hemmed and hawed" over backing Clinton until watching her testimony. He wrote that she showed "enormous courage, patience and dignity."

It's probably not the best idea to bring up Kosovo since this was Bill's War and one of HRC's scandals eg

http://message.snopes.com/showthread.php?t=27856You are incorrect. He voted yes on DISallowing additional funds to be sent, which was twice the amount the military said they needed to continue the mission. [removed]Your subreddit is bad and you should feel badNo, you're right, we just hand over the 2016 elections to the republicans by touting the Ron Paul of the left. Bernie is actually sane. Ron Paul is not. 

And keep up with the fear mongering. I'm not trying to hand the elections to the corporatist warmonger that you're trying to push either.
An unbiased recounting of HRC's role in the Clinton Administration

**Health Care Reform:** When Bill Clinton was President, Hillary assumed authority over health care reform efforts. Around $13 million of taxpayer money was spent on studies and promotions. Despite these efforts, however, the issue was never voted on in Congress.

**Selecting an Attorney General:** President Clinton put Hillary in charge of the nomination process for AG. Her first two selections, Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, eventually withdrew their names from consideration. Her next recommendation was Janet Reno, who was confirmed as AG. President Clinton would come to call this decision his "worst mistake."

**Other notable HRC recommendations for Administration positions:** Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. These men were chosen from among old friends of the Clinton's during their days practicing law in Little Rock. Hubbel would eventually go to prison, Foster tragically committed suicide, and Kennedy would go on to resign in shame.

**“Travelgate”:** (scandal involving the White House Travel Office's refusal to allow Hillary to award travel contracts to longtime Clinton friend Harry Thompson.) Several members of the WH Travel Office were investigated by the FBI, and later let go from their positions. The resulting investigation lasted 36 months, and led to one criminal indictment - that of Travel Officer staffer Billy Dale for "mixing personal funds with White House funds." Dale had this charge acquitted in a trial by jury.

**"Filegate":** The Director of White House security, Craig Livingstone, was another longtime Clinton friend and Hillary recommendation. Director Livingstone came under investigation by the FBI during the "Filegate" scandal which alleged the Clinton Administration had illegal accessed hundreds of their political "enemies" private documents. During the investigation, the Clintons would deny ever knowing Livingstone outside of a professional capacity. After the Director's resignation, the FBI shut down the White House Liaison Office.

**President Clinton's impeachment and the Starr investigation:** While under indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation, Hillary repeated variations of “I do not recall” 56 times while giving testimony. She was eventually cleared of wrongdoing. 

**And here's one just for fun:** after leaving the White House, the Clinton's were asked to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that had gone missing.This is a great survey of recent news about the email scandal.Truth like this hurtsI don't like Hillary but I thought she handled that really wellIt was wordy but I agree. Oh hey, it's the dailyfail.Oh hey, it's the dailyfail.

Brainwashed lemmingJust another example of how she is willing to do and say anything. Once it become acceptable to be gay, no thanks her, now she includes it in her platform proudly. Now that Bernie has caught fire, she will change her positions once again to become more progressive just to get votes.

As far as I know only Chafee was a Republican in adult life.She also writes about volunteering to check voter registration lists against addresses to find voter fraud. And during her first year of college, she was even elected president of the Wellesley Young Republicans Club. According to Carl Bernstein's book A Woman In Charge, by the fall of 1966, she identified herself as a Rockefeller Republican.In other words I'm right, unless you count being a college freshman, before most people even form their own independent political beliefs, part of adult life.at 18 you are an adult in the eyes of the law.  at 18 you can vote and help shape the future of the nation.  at 18 you can go to war and kill or be killed.  at what age should we start holding someone accountable for the actions then?  not saying you should set your bench mark at this early of an age, but the statement true and when you try and side step it it only makes me look and think about it more than i would have... like now.  thanksI guess I just don't know why you think anybody would care that somebody was a Republican at 19. Certainly anybody that hardcore of a Democrat would already be turned off by the fact that in this same forum is a link to an article in a conservative outlet urging Clinton to embrace the TPP.i could care less what she did then.  i was just saying don't say she wasn't, when she was.  it is that kind of stuff why i don't trust any thing with the name clinton next to it.  whenever a clinton trys a dodge i just ask why?  like i do for every perosn wanting my vote and i would hope you would do the same.  i am much more concerned about how she is side stepping ttp right now and her current relationship to wall street.  could you agree with that?Then what the hell are you doing splitting hairs about whether a 19-year old is an adult?excuse me didn't think i was.  thought i was responding to the idea that she was a child and kids don't know anything anything any how, so what defence.  again there is enough current issue to care about.
I wonder how much this influences her Ukraine policies, as well.> So how does an email about that translate into news?
>The emails are insightful because she really didn't know what to do. She looked to all these outside advisors. She wanted to know how [then-Senator] Carl Levin voted on the Iraq surge. What the email shows is that this is a person who was very concerned at the time about how her decision—her important, important policy decision—would reflect upon her personally, and how it would impact her standing with the public. That's important.Also shows why she shouldn't have been in that role.And why she shouldn't have an even more responsible role. Yep. How many articles can you write that have a title that starts with "Hillary's shifting stance on..."Which is horrifying. > Of course, Hillary Clinton has big policy disagreements with Dick Cheney. But as a United States senator, she joined him in favoring an Authorization for Use of Military Force that significantly expanded executive power; an outside-the-U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay; a preemptive war against Iraq; the Patriot Act, with its many civil-liberties abrogations; an expansive program of extra-legal, warrantless surveillance on tens of millions of innocent Americans; and the use of lethal drone strikes over civilian populations in Pakistan and Yemen. 

Yeah, still not seeing the big policy differences between the two at all.Learn about the policies adopted by Obama and Clinton when she was Secretary of State: extrajudicial assassinations, a secretive evaluation process of targets based on flimsy evidence, and military operations outside of war zones, all unaccountable to the public.I saw the title and wondered which one. I wasn't aware of that particular one. But, it did jog my memory on a whole host of scandals from the 1990's. None are perhaps "worst" by themselves, but they add up to a character who has a decades long career built upon secrecy, lies, coverups and questions left unanswered. Yeah, same. Obviously I didn't choose the title, I just used the same one Salon used.

There is a decent argument that this is the worst legacy of the Clintons, though, in that it preys upon the most vulnerable people in society: the children of poor people.

The fact that we as a country would let them go hungry and flounder in poverty when we could easily afford to feed, clothe, and educate them is extraordinarily disgraceful.Al Jazeera's take on far right foreign policy dominating US politics in Latin America: http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/9/hillary-clinton-honduraslatinamericaforeignpolicy.htmlObviously she doesn't really care given her attempt to disarm the public and take away the right of people to defend themselves from life threatening situations. I really wish anderson would've pressed hillary about what new information could've possibly been revealed to her about same sex marriage.

Hillary has been a lifelong and tireless opponent of marriage equality until it was politically expedient for her to adjust her position.And they say she is not honest . . . 

The key role of US military-industrial policy is to clear the way for corporate hegemony. While generally opposed to sound bites, I wish there was a way to explain all that in a sentence or two.This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://theintercept.com/2015/10/14/what-did-clinton-mean-when-she-said-snowden-files-fell-into-the-wrong-hands/) reduced by 85%.

> Hillary Clinton asserted at Tuesday night&#039;s Democratic presidential debate that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden &quot;Stole very important information that has unfortunately fallen into a lot of the wrong hands."

> Snowden turned over his cache of documents to Intercept founding editors Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, and the result has been the exposure - to the public - of the extraordinarily expansive and invasive surveillance apparatus that the U.S. government had secretly built over the years.

> Clinton&#039;s comments on Snowden were flawed in more than one way.

Don't forget the way she treats the ones that protect her! http://newsdailynow.com/2015/10/17/the-real-and-nasty-hillary/Link to full video: http://www.c-span.org/video/?69606-1/mrs-clinton-campaign-speechI had completely forgotten about this. Also the whole bill ayers/weathermen thing, too. Hillary accused Obama of...well, I'm not sure of what...being dangerous? Because he served on a school board with Bill Ayers.

At least she admitted he's not a muslim...[as far as she knows.](https://vine.co/v/OQrxv5wIMmE)
