1.6 billion Muslims, and if you are Christian in some of those places you don't count. Do not have a church and do not speak of your faith. There are if my math is right 5.4 billion non muslims. 1.6 billion muslims and a war between the two is coming. It is being forced by 0-003% of the Muslims.vote trump for presidentI like the Don more every day. Now - you're just scaring me.Nobody cares Jeb you are not going to win.Huh? Read some of my comment history ya doofus.Why, are you Jeb? If so I am forming a super pac to air a commercial about how you helped your bro steal an election but three towers fell in their own footprint thereby ending the controversy. Wow........"He's wrong.  He's totally wrong."  I really like this about trump.  If you can't say no to anything, if you can't use your judgment to say no, then you can't really say yes to anything either.  He can answer your question without groveling and covering his tracks.  Is the last one in reference to Fox's practice of only hiring female anchors with large breasts?No it's about him having hot, young women and wivesThis comment has been overwritten by an open source script to protect this user&apos;s privacy.

The ridiculous entertainment that is Trump just keeps on giving...Trump/Scott 2016

Now he can fire twice as many people.Who is Ronald Farber?  

http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/Ronald_Farber/library/?sort=3&page=1dam right his support is stable, we are SICK of the establishment and pseudo freedom of speech and we are MAD, the new rise of nationalism is in its infant stages but do not doubt its return!That's right.

He is going to win the nomination and then he is going to win the Presidency.

These analysts are idiots.Who's smart?Funny how even the GOPiberal establishment continues to try and downplay Trump. Yes we have all hear of his liberal leanings. But if if he is a nationalist, and loves America, then we can't really lose considering the alternatives. I mean seriously. If a non-American Muslim Kenyan can steal the White House, nothing worse can really happen except total socialism. And Donald is not a socialist. read it, still voting for him, hell maybe even twiceThese hit pieces are just getting sad. 

TIL what passes for convincing arguments in the retarded stoner community.Every stoner I know loves the Donald.our enemies are many but our trump is strongAmerica is so much better than Trump. He's a clown who has rallied morons.I would give some other advice: move to Canada!

Much better country (assuming that Stephen Harper doesn't get reelected this year).his ideas are quite valid and lets be honest he would make America a better place then any other candidate 
Let's be honest you have no idea what you're talking aboutI was under the impression that is polling numbers against Hillary were very poor. He might be able to win the primary but I haven't seen good numbers for him in the general. Agree, I think it's still the DNC's to lose. I think that Trump, regardless of his final performance, has revitalized America's interest in national politics, and that makes his entry all the better. It reminds me very much of Arnold's run for Governator. Who's more foolish? The fool, or the one who follows him?
- Alec Guiness, "Star Wars"Yeah it'll be real funny when he gives birth to a new political ideology huh? Or when creates functioning borders? Or is the really funny part the one where he wants to protect American industry with a tarriff?Fuck you. Mr. Trump! Is that you!?  =D Die nigger.

The tech companies are actually trying to hire some quality people that meets their needs, and they're struggling because the H1B quota are filled by these Indian human smuggling companies. Do you really think Facebook and Google are competing with each other by lowering engineering cost? Give me a break.we did that already... didnt workHaha, says a TV show host. "You can't be serious, right? Everybody knows our TV shows are full of BS."I love how they continue to insult and deride him.Down voters(read:pr company's)  got a day off? And I would say Trump if he keeps up his momentum has a chance to win the primary outright. I wrote an article about the reasons why if your opinion contests.

https://medium.com/j-king-s-labratory-project/is-donald-trump-legitimately-winning-the-republican-primary-5e9f6aaabc1fArticle is on point.... I agree that he has a shot simply based on the fact he is uprooting the traditional campaigning strategies in a lot of ways.This is an interesting Movie about Trump. Has anyone seen this yet? Anyone think that it is a fair view of Trump's past, or are the makers out to make him look bad?what a pinheadDonald Trump was eye humping the girl.He was thinking that only common people do the wave.  He thinks that he is above all that.  He thinks that he is above the wave.  I think he had a really good idea. Like it would be perfect if a lightbulb popped up by his fingerPLEASE let Trump win the primaries!!! 

He's a god's gift to democrats. He might win amongst racist lunatics, but by the time we get to the national election, he'll have said so much batshit crazy stuff....he'll simply crash and burn. 

I also love how he makes Republicans show their grue colors. No one's forcing them to support that lunatic and while they've at least tried to hide all their ugly racism in the past...they finally gave up on that. 

I for one am cheering for that lunatic because he's entertaining and will completely obliterate the GOP from within :D

Donald, Donald, Donald!!!! Chant with me :DCan one truly lose what one never had?If this news doesn't kill Trump's campaign, nothing will :(The GOP may have to discard the popular vote in the primaries to avoid giving Trump the nomination.I wonder if he's really going crazy or if he is experiencing apotheosis. They probably look the same from the outside.If Trump is experiencing apotheosis than the peak of human development is to be an asshole and that's the way God designed the human race.

/me looks at the state of the world around him.

That... Kinda makes sense.Thing is his explanation makes sense. 'Her eyes, her whatever...' was him finishing the thought and getting back to topic. His flipping of the accusation back on the media is brilliant, 'only a deviant' would associate that statement with a menstrual cycle.He also used the same meme when talking about chuck schumer a week ago.

(schumer doesnt have a vagina that we know of proving the phrase has nothing to do with periods)

D's America's only eight-star generalCan't dump the Trump!http://media.giphy.com/media/XreQmk7ETCak0/giphy.gifTrump is the only peacenic up there.Well, if he doesn't get elected get that DYI shelter instructions anyway because Iran will for sure play bomb this, bomb that, once they have the nukes.I wouldn't worry. His novelty will wear off, hopefully. He's America's only eight-star general.I'll vote for him in the primary if he does this. It wouldn't matter AT ALL because of how my stupid state sets up primaries, so I would totally do it.What a masturbatory and stupid letter. He will make America great again. And all the other countries will turn into Tony the tigers. And when asked about America, the other countries will reapond, " They're Great!"He will make it the most luxurious, most glorious house in the world. It will be a tear-down job, and in place of the White House he will erect something not unlike the Trump Taj Mahal.With gold everywhere... A new color will appear in the palette: "Trump Gold". The most magnifcent tacky, er... shimmering, auriferous hues one could ever behold.Missile launchers conspicuously placed around the perimeterI get that this is a joke but some of the things are believable. Could you reformulate with one that isn't such a "let me try to be funny!!!1!"I'm voting for trumpWe want the truth but Planned Parenthood keeps trying to fetus lies.I honestly can't tell when people on this sub are pro trump and when they are making fun of his supporters.It's a mix I think. I live in Norway (from the UK), and as a big fan of US politics I'm following Trump closely. For entertainment value of course.Im both.School for the gifted, the short bus already left.It would be amazing [if Dale Carnegie responded](https://soundcloud.com/trumpdate/august-2nd-2015-treat-me-fairly-or-else#t=4:58) to [Donald Trump's statement about his book](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/06/donald-trump/donald-trumps-art-deal-best-selling-business-book-/) considering [he died in 1955](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie).The emptiness of this thread is tellingHe could blame Jewish bankers for all the world's ills, maybe that would derail him, maybe.It's funny how they always use this pic. Wow, the Donald looking great!This cracks me up!

Eric Trump (his mini me) - housing and urban developmentOh yeah, forgot about the nepotism angle. Good call!Jeb is getting trumpled.crazy that the koch brothers have so much power in the political world. they don't care who becomes president because they back most of them..Lol, he probably spits at them on the golf course.That's what happens when you have something to say not like these other cuckservative clowns. Amen to that brother! He's going to make America great again. That's awesome.I wonder if this guy becomes president, would threatening a lawsuit to silence a citizen be a violation of the first amendment? It would basically be a classic case of the government trying to silence a citizen which is truly what the first amendment is about and why it was written in the first place. Wouldn't it?  
At some point his tactic if "If I say it, then it is true and if you challenge me you are ugly, jealous and a jerk," will stop working. It can't sustain itself. It just can't.The fact that these types of blackmail oriented  things are starting to come up shows that the bush cronies in the cia are really pulling out all the stops against trump who challenges their control of the white house.

She said she loves him and endorses him.I'll bet he felt pretty violated too.Weak.Probably the worst thing that could have happened to Trump.

Read your rules.  "racism" ?  "sexism" ?  That's the language of the people that Trump supporters hate.  Finding people to all agree that being against some kind of "ism" is easy.  Finding minds that can think beyond that, and to put it into it's proper place (subordinate to everything else) is what's difficult.  And that is why Trump has so much support.  Not from you though.  Too juvenile.There's some truth to what Trump says.  Being captured is not the same level of "heroism" as winning a war, killing a bunch of enemy, saving the lives of your fellow soldiers, or other "valor in the face of the enemy" type of action.  It's not heroic like getting killed doing something very dangerous, and it's not heroic like getting killed in the twin towers.

What everyone is missing is the fact that 90% of Trump's support come from people that hate the media.  Many of them do not even know they hate the media.  They (we) hear the constant stream of lies and half-truths that come from that idiot-box, and we've learned to disbelieve everything it says, and hate everything it spews out.  Gays getting married, Mexicans crossing the border, Iraq and Afghanistan being given back to the terrorists, Obama socializing the nation's health care, etc... added all up this is a complete justification for Civil War.  They should be THANKING Trump for giving the American People a way to express their rage that does not include the wholesale slaughter of the elected officials that are 100% responsible for everything.

Me, personally, I have no illusions.  He's exactly what he looks like.  He's a KNOWN QUANTITY, and in this political environment he's the ONLY known quantity.  I'm voting for him no matter what.  They can have high-def videos of Donald Trump boiling neighborhood children alive and then eating them with spinach fettuccine noodles and I will STILL vote for him.  MOST hated is the Republican Party.  They keep lying about how Jeb Bush has "xx%" popularity.  BULL SHIT.  Every time they tell that lie I resolve to make certain to do whatever I can to disrupt their plans.The poll that had trump at 28% and Bush at 13% also asked people who their second choice was. Bush only got 5%. How's he going to win? The establishment wants him but the people watching fox news and listening to talk radio see Bush as part of the problem and won't vote for him. probably the worst structured article i have ever read...  And i'm not even picking sides here, but that just seemed so damn repetitive.

It got its point across. Yeah but I mean, you don't think a argument or even an article loses credibility when it is poorly structured?  that's all i was trying to say...  I get he wanted to bash Trump and portray him as indulging in his career/wealth while McCain was a at war getting caught, but i don't need to be reminded he graduated with 200k of wealth, 3x in the article.  
Oh, I totally agree that the article was long and poorly written. I'm pretty used to that. Do I think it loses credibility with the masses? Nah, they'll probably stop reading a third of the way through and still get the point: Donald was playing around with Daddy's money while McCain was fighting for his country. was totally expecting you to go off on me there.  i appreciate the clarification.  and yeah, i agree with you on this one.  Haha, nope not going off on you! I've just gotten so used to poorly written stuff online that it doesn't even faze me anymore. They're not writing for people who appreciate decent writing. They're writing for people who skim. I doubt they even hire actual writers. So I look for the content (if there is any) and just move on. I just hope in 20 years people still know how to read and write beyond lolz and omg. 

Trump fits this model perfectly. He's good at generating dramatic buzzwords without content, which the masses apparently love. The clickbait candidate. couldn't have said it betterCan I hear a good one liner?There are no guys with tits, only chicks with dicks 
You got it backwards. 

Edit: I'm backwards -_-clarify??Waaaaait a minute. I'm on backwards! 

Carry on. Are you pro trump?Ahhh honestly, i don't know enough of his policies to say i'm behind him, but I do agree with his economical views of USA.  He does get taken out of context, but he really is a prick.  
 to add one more piece here.  The man is a capitalist, and has some decent motives for our economy. i see him more as a piece to shape up our other Repubs for the primaries.This guy is a democrats wet dream. People now associate his offensive remarks and personality with the GOP. I think by offending all Hispanics he has already handed the election to Hillary. The reason the vast majority of world leaders prefer freer trade is it's much better for all citizens. Economics figured this out in the 19th century. If we impose import tariffs our trading partners will impose tariffs on our goods. This will hurt american producers more than it will help them. On the one hand they could sell more goods domestically. On the other we can't compete in Europe, China, India, etc. we shouldn't be producing everything we need domestically we are much better off with each country producing what it has a competitive advantage in. David Ricardo discovered this in the 19th century. You're free to believe that restricted trade is better. You've got good company, Bernie sanders for one. 

There are better pro trump subs. This one is for people of all political persuasions who are rudder necking trump's campaign. Yeah? And how much are we exporting now a days?1.23 trillion dollars worth of goods. 

Our top consumers are Canada and Mexico thanks to NAFTA. China is right behind them.

source: https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/usa/Oh? And how much are we importing? 1.8 trillion dollars worth of goods. Mostly from those same countries, with China taking a substantial lead. A trade deficit is a bad thing, but forcing american consumers to consume the same goods produced in America for way more money hurts the american consumer greatly. Trade deficit doesn't show the full picture. We also export services and make a lot of money from international tourism. It's like the cat in the hat. Yes we can fix a trade deficit with tariffs, but we ruin a lot of other things. The other thing to keep in mind is factory jobs aren't very desirable. They are monotonous and low paying.Bad for American consumers, not for American workers. Which is more important?
  
I would pause before painting all industrial jobs as unsatisfactory. There is a certain accomplishment that comes with creating something concrete and being part of a functional system. They also earned a hell of a lot more money than their modern compatriots - stuck working in food service or in Walmart. The high-wage industries that still exist in America are generally pretty low workforce - at least outside of the factories they contract with in China. 
  
But, oh, hey, I can get a pack of tubesocks for $2
  
American consumer and American workers are the same people. This isn't about picking sides. Economic theory shows us society as a whole with free trade. There is also lots of empiracle evidence. To put it in terms that might resonate with a trump supporter, import tariffs is a failed policy.  Only losers support it. Not all the time - there are plenty of consumers that are out of the workforce: retired, in school full-time, the chronically unemployed. Besides that pedantric point, I have to ask - is lower prices for consumers a worthy end goal and measure of success. Is it more important than high employment? Higher wages? A sense of dignity in work? The very culture of making physical objects?
  
Kind of presumptuous to say I am a Trump supporter. Non-establishment candidates in both parties are anti-free trade. 
  
>>Economic theory shows us society as a whole with free trade. There is also lots of empiracle evidence.
  
Haha ok /u/turdsworth - thanks for saving my thumbs some work. Take care man. 

Edit: I actually care about being comprehensible. content liek this shouldn't be getting downvoted so bad no one sees it. This is why I think we should disable downvoting cause all the trump supporters are trolling this sub.I support trumpWhat has has Donald trump said that's wrong about immigration? He's against illegal immigration, and for LEGAL immigration. What he said about ILLEGAL Aliens bringing in crime is true, because the fact that they are in in this country is already a crime, plus there're committing even more crimes. I think he is getting flak from the way he said it. It could be interpreted that all illegal immigrants are criminals and rapists. http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/06/29/donald_trump_fired_from_nbc_celebrity_apprentice_star_and_republican_presidential.htmlExactly. His positions aren't different than the rest of the field. What is different is the tone. People think it's weird that trump isn't acting like s typical politician. The thing is people are sick and tired of typical politicians. Yes, but the tone came off all wrong, I bet he lost the latino vote with his remarks which managed to offend many.There was some polling I saw that showed different republicans matched up with Hillary Clinton. No one did worse among Latinos than trump.  Surprisingly the difference wasn't large. I think Latinos aren't going to vote republican anyway. The problem as I see it is that trump hurts the entire republican brand for years among Latinos. Here is a very recent one that states trump is very unpopular with the latino vote : http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-07162015-htmlstory.htmlTrump supporters are coming in and down voting anything critical of trump. It's distorting the scores. Credit to /u/TehSasquachJust two classy guys duking it outThey should probably settle this with a bunch of cream pies and olde time bottles of seltzer. It's for him in the sense that his campaign is a positive thing for progressives.  We certainly wouldn't want him to actually be president.  He's awful.ok, just wanted to make sure you don't want him as president too, that would be awfulThere are other pro trump subs. this one seems to enjoy the show.this should be a stickyIt's hard to tell the difference between the two.This has a pretty strong left wing bias, but the polling analyses is good.I heard him say that he was spending his own money and wouldn't be beholden to to donators or corporations as president. I didn't know he had a fundraising part to his campaign.People have started super pacs for him. I have no idea what's happening. Is this performance art? Does here really want to make America great again? When was America great? Is this real life? He's such a massive clown. You don't even need a comedian, just let the man speak :Doh gawd what fake dramaI love drama Also, those aren't "Nazi" uniforms. They are Wehrmacht uniforms. Not related to NSDAP uniforms.How come almost all the articles about Trump in a subreddit named /r/Donald_Trump are negative towards him? 
The media is really trying to ruin his name lol, they are so desperate... 
The man is speaking too much truth and it's making the greedy, incompetent leftists who have ruined USA feel uncomfortable.there are other pro trump subs this is the description of /r/donald_trump

> Perhaps no man has done as much to advance the progressive agenda as Donald Trump in the past 1000 years. Okay, maybe that's a slight exaggeration. Still, we should celebrate "The Donald". The man. The myth. The hair. What group of hardworking Americans will he offend next? Find out here. Join us!

check out /r/thedonald or /r/donaldtrump2016Thanks. I'm not American but I like seeing that Americans might finally vote for the right man and save their country from certain doom the recent leaders have brought.can I ask where are you from?Finland.How did you become interested in Trump?I already said. I want to see Americans get in their senses and save their country. USA is doing very badly and ALL the other candidates except Trump intend to destroy USA even further, just to line their pockets with a bit more cash. They don't care about anything else.So he destroyed the USFL, and now he can destroy the GOP... hahahaSeems reasonable /sconsidering this entire sub is a left wing attack on trump, id say both parties of scared of him...which is why i like him. so sick of thoughtless party hacks like you and the right wing version of you.This sub fully supports Mr. Trump in the primary. har-har-har you're so clever... 

you are a clownI wasn't joking. I would be thrilled if he were the nominee.you're the type of guy who thinks he is the smartest guy in the room... http://www.memes.com/meme/622205
Doubt it.Every day that Trump is in the race, more Hispanics become uncomfortable with the GOP.I love how they forget his comments were referring to illegal immigrants, not Hispanics at large.Trump has hit a nerve that no other candidate has. Illegal migration across our southern borders has not been addressed by either party. Quite a few people are seeing the problems that this 'blindness' has wrought. Trump is his own man all the rest march to the beat of a drum they don't beat.LOL, 'nothing here' either hehe. The Donald must be losing sleep over this post.http://imgur.com/U87Ujm3[deleted]Racist language is not tolerated here.
